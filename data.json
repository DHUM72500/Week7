Perhaps. But what\nabout science fiction's next stroke of clair\nvoyance? Just a short time after Pearl Harbor,\nanother pulp-magazine yarn described the\ndropping of an atomic empire-buster on\nJapan. That's the way science fiction end\ned the war, ami that'\u00bb the way history\nwound it up three years later.\nNow, if those two were the only successful\n\"guesses,\" we could just chalk the whole thing\nup to some author's pipe-dreaming type\nwriter, and let the whole matter drop.\nhistory.

R. Oppen\nheimer and fellow atomic scientists; R. S.\nRichardson, solar specialist of Mt. Wilson\nObservatory; John R. Pierce, inventor of the\ntraveling wave amplifier; Willy Ley, author\nof \"Rockets.\"\nBig-nun\u00b7 By-lincc\nWhen Dr. Herman J.

B. S.

G. Wells, fiction's\nmost prolific inventor of fabulous gadgets.\nSF readers are blas\u00e9, almost incapable of\nsurprise and amazement. To them \"Astoynd\ning's\" sundering of the atom was no more\nexciting than splitting an infinitive.
