    "## Objectives\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to get some hands-on experience putting what you've seen in tutorials about importing and working with text in Python into practice. You'll also be asked to put the reading you've been doing all semester into conversation with the process of importing, cleaning, and preparing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The object of the notebooks this week is: \n",
    "* To practice several ways of importing text into your Python environment to study; \n",
    "* To become more familiar with various pipelines for cleaning and preparing data for text analysis; \n",
    "* To consider the challenges that the availability and scarcity of data presents to the literary scholar (and to consider how other kinds of research might also need to address similar issues); \n",
    "* To connect examples of real-world text analysis projects with the practical process of cleaning and preparing data. "

    "## Importing Data\n",
    "You've worked with data during the Datacamp exercises, but that was a much more controlled environment. When you are actually doing your own text analysis project, you will have a much messier process. During this week's reading, you will have read several pieces about what cleaning takes place and some of the challenges that data presents when working with text. In particular, we're looking at text analysis from a humanities / litereary perspective; however, one might argue that these challenges are more similar to the text analysis one might perform in the social sciences or with non-fiction work than might appear to be the case on the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll practice importing data: \n",
    "* from a file already on your computer (using a directory path); \n",
    "* from a file on the web using a URL request \n",
    "* from a file on the web using Beautiful Soup. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other ways to collect data, and perhaps some of our time could / should be spent on webscraping in order to collect data. The easiest way to get lots of data is by importing with an API. For those who are looking for a challenge, try importing Movie Reviews from the New York Times via their API for your notebook assignment this week instead. Be sure to use BeautifulSoup to prettify it, and then store the data in a pandas dataframe. "

We'll use a `for` loop, which simply means that we'll do an action that repeats until we tell it to stop. The following code says that we want to `open` the file `herland.txt` so we can read it (argument `mode='r'`). Then we're going to close the file. When we do this, we're going to assign a variable name to the resulting data, which is now a string called `file`.\n",

      "This is written from memory, unfortunately. If I could have brought with\n",
      "me the material I so carefully prepared, this would be a very different\n",
      "story. Whole books full of notes, carefully copied records, firsthand\n",
      "descriptions, and the pictures--that’s the worst loss. We had some\n",
      "bird’s-eyes of the cities and parks; a lot of lovely views of streets,\n",
      "of buildings, outside and in, and some of those gorgeous gardens, and,\n",
      "most important of all, of the women themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody will ever believe how they looked. Descriptions aren’t any good\n",
      "when it comes to women, and I never was good at descriptions anyhow. But\n",
      "it’s got to be done somehow; the rest of the world needs to know about\n",
      "that country.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven’t said where it was for fear some self-appointed missionaries,\n",
      "or traders, or land-greedy expansionists, will take it upon themselves\n",
      "to push in. They will not be wanted, I can tell them that, and will fare\n",
      "worse than we did if they do find it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It began this way. There were three of us, classmates and friends--Terry\n",
      "O. Nicholson (we used to call him the Old Nick, with good reason), Jeff\n",
      "Margrave, and I, Vandyck Jennings.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had known each other years and years, and in spite of our differences\n",
      "we had a good deal in common. All of us were interested in science.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry was rich enough to do as he pleased. His great aim was\n",
      "exploration. He used to make all kinds of a row because there was\n",
      "nothing left to explore now, only patchwork and filling in, he said. He\n",
      "filled in well enough--he had a lot of talents--great on mechanics and\n",
      "electricity. Had all kinds of boats and motorcars, and was one of the\n",
      "best of our airmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "We never could have done the thing at all without Terry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff Margrave was born to be a poet, a botanist--or both--but his folks\n",
      "persuaded him to be a doctor instead. He was a good one, for his age,\n",
      "but his real interest was in what he loved to call “the wonders of\n",
      "science.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As for me, sociology’s my major. You have to back that up with a lot of\n",
      "other sciences, of course. I’m interested in them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry was strong on facts--geography and meteorology and those; Jeff\n",
      "could beat him any time on biology, and I didn’t care what it was they\n",
      "talked about, so long as it connected with human life, somehow. There\n",
      "are few things that don’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "We three had a chance to join a big scientific expedition. They needed\n",
      "a doctor, and that gave Jeff an excuse for dropping his just opening\n",
      "practice; they needed Terry’s experience, his machine, and his money;\n",
      "and as for me, I got in through Terry’s influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The expedition was up among the thousand tributaries and enormous\n",
      "hinterland of a great river, up where the maps had to be made, savage\n",
      "dialects studied, and all manner of strange flora and fauna expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this story is not about that expedition. That was only the merest\n",
      "starter for ours.\n",
      "\n",
      "My interest was first roused by talk among our guides. I’m quick at\n",
      "languages, know a good many, and pick them up readily. What with that\n",
      "and a really good interpreter we took with us, I made out quite a few\n",
      "legends and folk myths of these scattered tribes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as we got farther and farther upstream, in a dark tangle of rivers,\n",
      "lakes, morasses, and dense forests, with here and there an unexpected\n",
      "long spur running out from the big mountains beyond, I noticed that more\n",
      "and more of these savages had a story about a strange and terrible Woman\n",
      "Land in the high distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Up yonder,” “Over there,” “Way up”--was all the direction they could\n",
      "offer, but their legends all agreed on the main point--that there was\n",
      "this strange country where no men lived--only women and girl children.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of them had ever seen it. It was dangerous, deadly, they said, for\n",
      "any man to go there. But there were tales of long ago, when some brave\n",
      "investigator had seen it--a Big Country, Big Houses, Plenty People--All\n",
      "Women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had no one else gone? Yes--a good many--but they never came back. It was\n",
      "no place for men--of that they seemed sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told the boys about these stories, and they laughed at them. Naturally\n",
      "I did myself. I knew the stuff that savage dreams are made of.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when we had reached our farthest point, just the day before we all\n",
      "had to turn around and start for home again, as the best of expeditions\n",
      "must in time, we three made a discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main encampment was on a spit of land running out into the main\n",
      "stream, or what we thought was the main stream. It had the same muddy\n",
      "color we had been seeing for weeks past, the same taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "I happened to speak of that river to our last guide, a rather superior\n",
      "fellow with quick, bright eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that there was another river--“over there, short river, sweet\n",
      "water, red and blue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was interested in this and anxious to see if I had understood, so I\n",
      "showed him a red and blue pencil I carried, and asked again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he pointed to the river, and then to the southwestward.\n",
      "“River--good water--red and blue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry was close by and interested in the fellow’s pointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What does he say, Van?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry blazed up at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ask him how far it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man indicated a short journey; I judged about two hours, maybe\n",
      "three.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s go,” urged Terry. “Just us three. Maybe we can really find\n",
      "something. May be cinnabar in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May be indigo,” Jeff suggested, with his lazy smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was early yet; we had just breakfasted; and leaving word that we’d\n",
      "be back before night, we got away quietly, not wishing to be thought\n",
      "too gullible if we failed, and secretly hoping to have some nice little\n",
      "discovery all to ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long two hours, nearer three. I fancy the savage could have\n",
      "done it alone much quicker. There was a desperate tangle of wood and\n",
      "water and a swampy patch we never should have found our way across\n",
      "alone. But there was one, and I could see Terry, with compass and\n",
      "notebook, marking directions and trying to place landmarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We came after a while to a sort of marshy lake, very big, so that the\n",
      "circling forest looked quite low and dim across it. Our guide told us\n",
      "that boats could go from there to our camp--but “long way--all day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This water was somewhat clearer than that we had left, but we could not\n",
      "judge well from the margin. We skirted it for another half hour or so,\n",
      "the ground growing firmer as we advanced, and presently we turned the\n",
      "corner of a wooded promontory and saw a quite different country--a\n",
      "sudden view of mountains, steep and bare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of those long easterly spurs,” Terry said appraisingly. “May be\n",
      "hundreds of miles from the range. They crop out like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly we left the lake and struck directly toward the cliffs. We\n",
      "heard running water before we reached it, and the guide pointed proudly\n",
      "to his river.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was short. We could see where it poured down a narrow vertical\n",
      "cataract from an opening in the face of the cliff. It was sweet water.\n",
      "The guide drank eagerly and so did we.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s snow water,” Terry announced. “Must come from way back in the\n",
      "hills.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But as to being red and blue--it was greenish in tint. The guide seemed\n",
      "not at all surprised. He hunted about a little and showed us a quiet\n",
      "marginal pool where there were smears of red along the border; yes, and\n",
      "of blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry got out his magnifying glass and squatted down to investigate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Chemicals of some sort--I can’t tell on the spot. Look to me like\n",
      "dyestuffs. Let’s get nearer,” he urged, “up there by the fall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We scrambled along the steep banks and got close to the pool that foamed\n",
      "and boiled beneath the falling water. Here we searched the border and\n",
      "found traces of color beyond dispute. More--Jeff suddenly held up an\n",
      "unlooked-for trophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only a rag, a long, raveled fragment of cloth. But it was a\n",
      "well-woven fabric, with a pattern, and of a clear scarlet that the water\n",
      "had not faded. No savage tribe that we had heard of made such fabrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guide stood serenely on the bank, well pleased with our excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One day blue--one day red--one day green,” he told us, and pulled from\n",
      "his pouch another strip of bright-hued cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come down,” he said, pointing to the cataract. “Woman Country--up\n",
      "there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we were interested. We had our rest and lunch right there and\n",
      "pumped the man for further information. He could tell us only what the\n",
      "others had--a land of women--no men--babies, but all girls. No place for\n",
      "men--dangerous. Some had gone to see--none had come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could see Terry’s jaw set at that. No place for men? Dangerous? He\n",
      "looked as if he might shin up the waterfall on the spot. But the guide\n",
      "would not hear of going up, even if there had been any possible method\n",
      "of scaling that sheer cliff, and we had to get back to our party before\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They might stay if we told them,” I suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Terry stopped in his tracks. “Look here, fellows,” he said. “This\n",
      "is our find. Let’s not tell those cocky old professors. Let’s go on home\n",
      "with ‘em, and then come back--just us--have a little expedition of our\n",
      "own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We looked at him, much impressed. There was something attractive to a\n",
      "bunch of unattached young men in finding an undiscovered country of a\n",
      "strictly Amazonian nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course we didn’t believe the story--but yet!\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no such cloth made by any of these local tribes,” I announced,\n",
      "examining those rags with great care. “Somewhere up yonder they spin and\n",
      "weave and dye--as well as we do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would mean a considerable civilization, Van. There couldn’t be\n",
      "such a place--and not known about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, well, I don’t know. What’s that old republic up in the Pyrenees\n",
      "somewhere--Andorra? Precious few people know anything about that, and\n",
      "it’s been minding its own business for a thousand years. Then there’s\n",
      "Montenegro--splendid little state--you could lose a dozen Montenegroes\n",
      "up and down these great ranges.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We discussed it hotly all the way back to camp. We discussed it with\n",
      "care and privacy on the voyage home. We discussed it after that, still\n",
      "only among ourselves, while Terry was making his arrangements.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was hot about it. Lucky he had so much money--we might have had to\n",
      "beg and advertise for years to start the thing, and then it would have\n",
      "been a matter of public amusement--just sport for the papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But T. O. Nicholson could fix up his big steam yacht, load his\n",
      "specially-made big motorboat aboard, and tuck in a “dissembled” biplane\n",
      "without any more notice than a snip in the society column.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had provisions and preventives and all manner of supplies. His\n",
      "previous experience stood him in good stead there. It was a very\n",
      "complete little outfit.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were to leave the yacht at the nearest safe port and go up that\n",
      "endless river in our motorboat, just the three of us and a pilot; then\n",
      "drop the pilot when we got to that last stopping place of the previous\n",
      "party, and hunt up that clear water stream ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motorboat we were going to leave at anchor in that wide shallow\n",
      "lake. It had a special covering of fitted armor, thin but strong, shut\n",
      "up like a clamshell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those natives can’t get into it, or hurt it, or move it,” Terry\n",
      "explained proudly. “We’ll start our flier from the lake and leave the\n",
      "boat as a base to come back to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we come back,” I suggested cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Fraid the ladies will eat you?” he scoffed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re not so sure about those ladies, you know,” drawled Jeff. “There\n",
      "may be a contingent of gentlemen with poisoned arrows or something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t need to go if you don’t want to,” Terry remarked drily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go? You’ll have to get an injunction to stop me!” Both Jeff and I were\n",
      "sure about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we did have differences of opinion, all the long way.\n",
      "\n",
      "An ocean voyage is an excellent time for discussion. Now we had no\n",
      "eavesdroppers, we could loll and loaf in our deck chairs and talk and\n",
      "talk--there was nothing else to do. Our absolute lack of facts only made\n",
      "the field of discussion wider.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll leave papers with our consul where the yacht stays,” Terry\n",
      "planned. “If we don’t come back in--say a month--they can send a relief\n",
      "party after us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A punitive expedition,” I urged. “If the ladies do eat us we must make\n",
      "reprisals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They can locate that last stopping place easy enough, and I’ve made a\n",
      "sort of chart of that lake and cliff and waterfall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but how will they get up?” asked Jeff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Same way we do, of course. If three valuable American citizens are lost\n",
      "up there, they will follow somehow--to say nothing of the glittering\n",
      "attractions of that fair land--let’s call it ‘Feminisia,’” he broke off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re right, Terry. Once the story gets out, the river will crawl with\n",
      "expeditions and the airships rise like a swarm of mosquitoes.” I laughed\n",
      "as I thought of it. “We’ve made a great mistake not to let Mr. Yellow\n",
      "Press in on this. Save us! What headlines!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not much!” said Terry grimly. “This is our party. We’re going to find\n",
      "that place alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you going to do with it when you do find it--if you do?” Jeff\n",

      "one--was just blossoming with roses and babies and canaries and tidies,\n",
      "and all that sort of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Terry, in his secret heart, had visions of a sort of sublimated\n",
      "summer resort--just Girls and Girls and Girls--and that he was going to\n",
      "be--well, Terry was popular among women even when there were other men\n",
      "around, and it’s not to be wondered at that he had pleasant dreams of\n",
      "what might happen. I could see it in his eyes as he lay there, looking\n",
      "at the long blue rollers slipping by, and fingering that impressive\n",
      "mustache of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I thought--then--that I could form a far clearer idea of what was\n",
      "before us than either of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re all off, boys,” I insisted. “If there is such a place--and there\n",
      "does seem some foundation for believing it--you’ll find it’s built on a\n",
      "sort of matriarchal principle, that’s all. The men have a separate cult\n",
      "of their own, less socially developed than the women, and make them an\n",
      "annual visit--a sort of wedding call. This is a condition known to have\n",
      "existed--here’s just a survival. They’ve got some peculiarly isolated\n",
      "valley or tableland up there, and their primeval customs have survived.\n",
      "That’s all there is to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How about the boys?” Jeff asked.\n",

      "“And how about this danger theory all our guides were so sure of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Danger enough, Terry, and we’ll have to be mighty careful. Women of\n",
      "that stage of culture are quite able to defend themselves and have no\n",
      "welcome for unseasonable visitors.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We talked and talked.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with all my airs of sociological superiority I was no nearer than\n",
      "any of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was funny though, in the light of what we did find, those extremely\n",
      "clear ideas of ours as to what a country of women would be like. It\n",
      "was no use to tell ourselves and one another that all this was idle\n",
      "speculation. We were idle and we did speculate, on the ocean voyage and\n",
      "the river voyage, too.\n",

      "We mustn’t look to find any sort of order and organization.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re dead wrong,” Jeff told him. “It will be like a nunnery under an\n",
      "abbess--a peaceful, harmonious sisterhood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I snorted derision at this idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nuns, indeed! Your peaceful sisterhoods were all celibate, Jeff, and\n",
      "under vows of obedience. These are just women, and mothers, and where\n",
      "there’s motherhood you don’t find sisterhood--not much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir--they’ll scrap,” agreed Terry. “Also we mustn’t look for\n",
      "inventions and progress; it’ll be awfully primitive.”\n",

      "“How about that cloth mill?” Jeff suggested.\n",

      "stop--you’ll see.”\n",

      "received, but he held his ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll see,” he insisted. “I’ll get solid with them all--and play one\n",

      "Solomon will have to take a back seat!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where do we come in on that deal?” I demanded. “Aren’t we Viziers or\n",
      "anything?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Couldn’t risk it,” he asserted solemnly. “You might start a\n",
      "revolution--probably would. No, you’ll have to be beheaded, or\n",
      "bowstrung--or whatever the popular method of execution is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’d have to do it yourself, remember,” grinned Jeff. “No husky black\n",

      "Van?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff’s ideas and Terry’s were so far apart that sometimes it was all\n",
      "I could do to keep the peace between them. Jeff idealized women in the\n",
      "best Southern style. He was full of chivalry and sentiment, and all\n",
      "that. And he was a good boy; he lived up to his ideals.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might say Terry did, too, if you can call his views about women\n",
      "anything so polite as ideals. I always liked Terry. He was a man’s man,\n",
      "very much so, generous and brave and clever; but I don’t think any of\n",
      "us in college days was quite pleased to have him with our sisters. We\n",
      "weren’t very stringent, heavens no! But Terry was “the limit.” Later\n",
      "on--why, of course a man’s life is his own, we held, and asked no\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But barring a possible exception in favor of a not impossible wife, or\n",
      "of his mother, or, of course, the fair relatives of his friends, Terry’s\n",
      "idea seemed to be that pretty women were just so much game and homely\n",
      "ones not worth considering.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was really unpleasant sometimes to see the notions he had.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I got out of patience with Jeff, too. He had such rose-colored halos\n",
      "on his womenfolks. I held a middle ground, highly scientific, of course,\n",
      "and used to argue learnedly about the physiological limitations of the\n",
      "sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were not in the least “advanced” on the woman question, any of us,\n",
      "then.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we joked and disputed and speculated, and after an interminable\n",
      "journey, we got to our old camping place at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not hard to find the river, just poking along that side till we\n",
      "came to it, and it was navigable as far as the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we reached that and slid out on its broad glistening bosom, with\n",
      "that high gray promontory running out toward us, and the straight white\n",
      "fall clearly visible, it began to be really exciting.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was some talk, even then, of skirting the rock wall and seeking\n",
      "a possible footway up, but the marshy jungle made that method look not\n",
      "only difficult but dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry dismissed the plan sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense, fellows! We’ve decided that. It might take months--we haven’t\n",
      "got the provisions. No, sir--we’ve got to take our chances. If we get\n",
      "back safe--all right. If we don’t, why, we’re not the first explorers to\n",
      "get lost in the shuffle. There are plenty to come after us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So we got the big biplane together and loaded it with our scientifically\n",
      "compressed baggage: the camera, of course; the glasses; a supply of\n",
      "concentrated food. Our pockets were magazines of small necessities, and\n",
      "we had our guns, of course--there was no knowing what might happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up and up and up we sailed, way up at first, to get “the lay of the\n",
      "land” and make note of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of that dark green sea of crowding forest this high-standing spur\n",
      "rose steeply. It ran back on either side, apparently, to the far-off\n",
      "white-crowned peaks in the distance, themselves probably inaccessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s make the first trip geographical,” I suggested. “Spy out the\n",
      "land, and drop back here for more gasoline. With your tremendous speed\n",
      "we can reach that range and back all right. Then we can leave a sort of\n",
      "map on board--for that relief expedition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s sense in that,” Terry agreed. “I’ll put off being king of\n",
      "Ladyland for one more day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So we made a long skirting voyage, turned the point of the cape which\n",
      "was close by, ran up one side of the triangle at our best speed, crossed\n",
      "over the base where it left the higher mountains, and so back to our\n",
      "lake by moonlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s not a bad little kingdom,” we agreed when it was roughly drawn\n",
      "and measured. We could tell the size fairly by our speed. And from what\n",
      "we could see of the sides--and that icy ridge at the back end--“It’s a\n",
      "pretty enterprising savage who would manage to get into it,” Jeff said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course we had looked at the land itself--eagerly, but we were too\n",
      "high and going too fast to see much. It appeared to be well forested\n",
      "about the edges, but in the interior there were wide plains, and\n",
      "everywhere parklike meadows and open places.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were cities, too; that I insisted. It looked--well, it looked like\n",
      "any other country--a civilized one, I mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had to sleep after that long sweep through the air, but we turned out\n",
      "early enough next day, and again we rose softly up the height till\n",
      "we could top the crowning trees and see the broad fair land at our\n",
      "pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Semitropical. Looks like a first-rate climate. It’s wonderful what a\n",
      "little height will do for temperature.” Terry was studying the forest\n",
      "growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Little height! Is that what you call little?” I asked. Our instruments\n",
      "measured it clearly. We had not realized the long gentle rise from the\n",
      "coast perhaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mighty lucky piece of land, I call it,” Terry pursued. “Now for the\n",
      "folks--I’ve had enough scenery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So we sailed low, crossing back and forth, quartering the country as we\n",
      "went, and studying it. We saw--I can’t remember now how much of this we\n",
      "noted then and how much was supplemented by our later knowledge, but we\n",
      "could not help seeing this much, even on that excited day--a land in a\n",
      "state of perfect cultivation, where even the forests looked as if they\n",
      "were cared for; a land that looked like an enormous park, only it was\n",
      "even more evidently an enormous garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t see any cattle,” I suggested, but Terry was silent. We were\n",
      "approaching a village.\n",
      "\n",
      "I confess that we paid small attention to the clean, well-built roads,\n",
      "to the attractive architecture, to the ordered beauty of the little\n",
      "town. We had our glasses out; even Terry, setting his machine for a\n",
      "spiral glide, clapped the binoculars to his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "They heard our whirring screw. They ran out of the houses--they gathered\n",
      "in from the fields, swift-running light figures, crowds of them. We\n",
      "stared and stared until it was almost too late to catch the levers,\n",
      "sweep off and rise again; and then we held our peace for a long run\n",
      "upward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gosh!” said Terry, after a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only women there--and children,” Jeff urged excitedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But they look--why, this is a CIVILIZED country!” I protested. “There\n",
      "must be men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course there are men,” said Terry. “Come on, let’s find ‘em.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He refused to listen to Jeff’s suggestion that we examine the country\n",
      "further before we risked leaving our machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a fine landing place right there where we came over,” he\n",
      "insisted, and it was an excellent one--a wide, flat-topped rock,\n",
      "overlooking the lake, and quite out of sight from the interior.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They won’t find this in a hurry,” he asserted, as we scrambled with the\n",
      "utmost difficulty down to safer footing. “Come on, boys--there were some\n",
      "good lookers in that bunch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course it was unwise of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite easy to see afterward that our best plan was to have\n",
      "studied the country more fully before we left our swooping airship and\n",
      "trusted ourselves to mere foot service. But we were three young men. We\n",
      "had been talking about this country for over a year, hardly believing\n",
      "that there was such a place, and now--we were in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looked safe and civilized enough, and among those upturned, crowding\n",
      "faces, though some were terrified enough, there was great beauty--on\n",
      "that we all agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on!” cried Terry, pushing forward. “Oh, come on! Here goes for\n",
      "Herland!”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not more than ten or fifteen miles we judged it from our landing rock to\n",
      "that last village. For all our eagerness we thought it wise to keep to\n",
      "the woods and go carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Terry’s ardor was held in check by his firm conviction that there\n",
      "were men to be met, and we saw to it that each of us had a good stock of\n",
      "cartridges.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They may be scarce, and they may be hidden away somewhere--some kind of\n",
      "a matriarchate, as Jeff tells us; for that matter, they may live up\n",
      "in the mountains yonder and keep the women in this part of the\n",
      "country--sort of a national harem! But there are men somewhere--didn’t\n",
      "you see the babies?”\n",
      "\n",
      "We had all seen babies, children big and little, everywhere that we had\n",
      "come near enough to distinguish the people. And though by dress we could\n",
      "not be sure of all the grown persons, still there had not been one man\n",
      "that we were certain of.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I always liked that Arab saying, ‘First tie your camel and then trust\n",
      "in the Lord,’” Jeff murmured; so we all had our weapons in hand, and\n",
      "stole cautiously through the forest. Terry studied it as we progressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Talk of civilization,” he cried softly in restrained enthusiasm. “I\n",
      "never saw a forest so petted, even in Germany. Look, there’s not a dead\n",
      "bough--the vines are trained--actually! And see here”--he stopped and\n",
      "looked about him, calling Jeff’s attention to the kinds of trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left me for a landmark and made a limited excursion on either side.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Food-bearing, practically all of them,” they announced returning. “The\n",
      "rest, splendid hardwood. Call this a forest? It’s a truck farm!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good thing to have a botanist on hand,” I agreed. “Sure there are no\n",
      "medicinal ones? Or any for pure ornament?”\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact they were quite right. These towering trees were\n",
      "under as careful cultivation as so many cabbages. In other conditions\n",
      "we should have found those woods full of fair foresters and fruit\n",
      "gatherers; but an airship is a conspicuous object, and by no means\n",
      "quiet--and women are cautious.\n",
      "\n",
      "All we found moving in those woods, as we started through them, were\n",
      "birds, some gorgeous, some musical, all so tame that it seemed almost\n",
      "to contradict our theory of cultivation--at least until we came upon\n",
      "occasional little glades, where carved stone seats and tables stood in\n",
      "the shade beside clear fountains, with shallow bird baths always added.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They don’t kill birds, and apparently they do kill cats,” Terry\n",
      "declared. “MUST be men here. Hark!”\n",
      "\n",
      "We had heard something: something not in the least like a birdsong, and\n",
      "very much like a suppressed whisper of laughter--a little happy sound,\n",
      "instantly smothered. We stood like so many pointers, and then used our\n",
      "glasses, swiftly, carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It couldn’t have been far off,” said Terry excitedly. “How about this\n",
      "big tree?”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a very large and beautiful tree in the glade we had just\n",
      "entered, with thick wide-spreading branches that sloped out in lapping\n",
      "fans like a beech or pine. It was trimmed underneath some twenty feet\n",
      "up, and stood there like a huge umbrella, with circling seats beneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look,” he pursued. “There are short stumps of branches left to climb\n",
      "on. There’s someone up that tree, I believe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We stole near, cautiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look out for a poisoned arrow in your eye,” I suggested, but Terry\n",
      "pressed forward, sprang up on the seat-back, and grasped the trunk. “In\n",
      "my heart, more likely,” he answered. “Gee! Look, boys!”\n",
      "\n",
      "We rushed close in and looked up. There among the boughs overhead was\n",
      "something--more than one something--that clung motionless, close to the\n",
      "great trunk at first, and then, as one and all we started up the tree,\n",
      "separated into three swift-moving figures and fled upward. As we climbed\n",
      "we could catch glimpses of them scattering above us. By the time we had\n",
      "reached about as far as three men together dared push, they had left the\n",
      "main trunk and moved outward, each one balanced on a long branch that\n",
      "dipped and swayed beneath the weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "We paused uncertain. If we pursued further, the boughs would break under\n",
      "the double burden. We might shake them off, perhaps, but none of us was\n",
      "so inclined. In the soft dappled light of these high regions, breathless\n",
      "with our rapid climb, we rested awhile, eagerly studying our objects\n",
      "of pursuit; while they in turn, with no more terror than a set of\n",
      "frolicsome children in a game of tag, sat as lightly as so many big\n",
      "bright birds on their precarious perches and frankly, curiously, stared\n",
      "at us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girls!” whispered Jeff, under his breath, as if they might fly if he\n",
      "spoke aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peaches!” added Terry, scarcely louder.\n",
      "“Peacherinos--apricot-nectarines! Whew!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were girls, of course, no boys could ever have shown that sparkling\n",
      "beauty, and yet none of us was certain at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "We saw short hair, hatless, loose, and shining; a suit of some light\n",
      "firm stuff, the closest of tunics and kneebreeches, met by trim gaiters.\n",
      "As bright and smooth as parrots and as unaware of danger, they swung\n",
      "there before us, wholly at ease, staring as we stared, till first one,\n",
      "and then all of them burst into peals of delighted laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was a torrent of soft talk tossed back and forth; no savage\n",
      "sing-song, but clear musical fluent speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "We met their laughter cordially, and doffed our hats to them, at which\n",
      "they laughed again, delightedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Terry, wholly in his element, made a polite speech, with\n",
      "explanatory gestures, and proceeded to introduce us, with pointing\n",
      "finger. “Mr. Jeff Margrave,” he said clearly; Jeff bowed as gracefully\n",
      "as a man could in the fork of a great limb. “Mr. Vandyck Jennings”--I\n",
      "also tried to make an effective salute and nearly lost my balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Terry laid his hand upon his chest--a fine chest he had, too,\n",
      "and introduced himself; he was braced carefully for the occasion and\n",
      "achieved an excellent obeisance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again they laughed delightedly, and the one nearest me followed his\n",
      "tactics.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Celis,” she said distinctly, pointing to the one in blue; “Alima”--the\n",
      "one in rose; then, with a vivid imitation of Terry’s impressive manner,\n",
      "she laid a firm delicate hand on her gold-green jerkin--“Ellador.” This\n",
      "was pleasant, but we got no nearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can’t sit here and learn the language,” Terry protested. He beckoned\n",
      "to them to come nearer, most winningly--but they gaily shook their\n",
      "heads. He suggested, by signs, that we all go down together; but again\n",
      "they shook their heads, still merrily. Then Ellador clearly indicated\n",
      "that we should go down, pointing to each and all of us, with\n",
      "unmistakable firmness; and further seeming to imply by the sweep of a\n",
      "lithe arm that we not only go downward, but go away altogether--at which\n",
      "we shook our heads in turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have to use bait,” grinned Terry. “I don’t know about you fellows,\n",
      "but I came prepared.” He produced from an inner pocket a little box of\n",
      "purple velvet, that opened with a snap--and out of it he drew a long\n",
      "sparkling thing, a necklace of big varicolored stones that would have\n",
      "been worth a million if real ones. He held it up, swung it, glittering\n",
      "in the sun, offered it first to one, then to another, holding it out as\n",
      "far as he could reach toward the girl nearest him. He stood braced\n",
      "in the fork, held firmly by one hand--the other, swinging his bright\n",
      "temptation, reached far out along the bough, but not quite to his full\n",
      "stretch.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was visibly moved, I noted, hesitated, spoke to her companions.\n",
      "They chattered softly together, one evidently warning her, the other\n",
      "encouraging. Then, softly and slowly, she drew nearer. This was Alima,\n",
      "a tall long-limbed lass, well-knit and evidently both strong and agile.\n",
      "Her eyes were splendid, wide, fearless, as free from suspicion as a\n",
      "child’s who has never been rebuked. Her interest was more that of\n",
      "an intent boy playing a fascinating game than of a girl lured by an\n",
      "ornament.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others moved a bit farther out, holding firmly, watching. Terry’s\n",
      "smile was irreproachable, but I did not like the look in his eyes--it\n",
      "was like a creature about to spring. I could already see it happen--the\n",
      "dropped necklace, the sudden clutching hand, the girl’s sharp cry as he\n",
      "seized her and drew her in. But it didn’t happen. She made a timid reach\n",
      "with her right hand for the gay swinging thing--he held it a little\n",
      "nearer--then, swift as light, she seized it from him with her left, and\n",
      "dropped on the instant to the bough below.\n",
      "\n",
      "He made his snatch, quite vainly, almost losing his position as his\n",
      "hand clutched only air; and then, with inconceivable rapidity, the three\n",
      "bright creatures were gone. They dropped from the ends of the big boughs\n",
      "to those below, fairly pouring themselves off the tree, while we climbed\n",
      "downward as swiftly as we could. We heard their vanishing gay laughter,\n",
      "we saw them fleeting away in the wide open reaches of the forest, and\n",
      "gave chase, but we might as well have chased wild antelopes; so we\n",
      "stopped at length somewhat breathless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No use,” gasped Terry. “They got away with it. My word! The men of this\n",
      "country must be good sprinters!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Inhabitants evidently arboreal,” I grimly suggested. “Civilized and\n",
      "still arboreal--peculiar people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shouldn’t have tried that way,” Jeff protested. “They were\n",
      "perfectly friendly; now we’ve scared them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was no use grumbling, and Terry refused to admit any mistake.\n",
      "“Nonsense,” he said. “They expected it. Women like to be run after. Come\n",
      "on, let’s get to that town; maybe we’ll find them there. Let’s see, it\n",
      "was in this direction and not far from the woods, as I remember.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When we reached the edge of the open country we reconnoitered with our\n",
      "field glasses. There it was, about four miles off, the same town, we\n",
      "concluded, unless, as Jeff ventured, they all had pink houses. The broad\n",
      "green fields and closely cultivated gardens sloped away at our feet, a\n",
      "long easy slant, with good roads winding pleasantly here and there, and\n",
      "narrower paths besides.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at that!” cried Jeff suddenly. “There they go!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure enough, close to the town, across a wide meadow, three bright-hued\n",
      "figures were running swiftly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How could they have got that far in this time? It can’t be the same\n",
      "ones,” I urged. But through the glasses we could identify our pretty\n",
      "tree-climbers quite plainly, at least by costume.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry watched them, we all did for that matter, till they disappeared\n",
      "among the houses. Then he put down his glass and turned to us, drawing\n",
      "a long breath. “Mother of Mike, boys--what Gorgeous Girls! To climb like\n",
      "that! to run like that! and afraid of nothing. This country suits me all\n",
      "right. Let’s get ahead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing venture, nothing have,” I suggested, but Terry preferred “Faint\n",
      "heart ne’er won fair lady.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We set forth in the open, walking briskly. “If there are any men, we’d\n",
      "better keep an eye out,” I suggested, but Jeff seemed lost in heavenly\n",
      "dreams, and Terry in highly practical plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a perfect road! What a heavenly country! See the flowers, will\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was Jeff, always an enthusiast; but we could agree with him fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The road was some sort of hard manufactured stuff, sloped slightly to\n",
      "shed rain, with every curve and grade and gutter as perfect as if it\n",
      "were Europe’s best. “No men, eh?” sneered Terry. On either side a double\n",
      "row of trees shaded the footpaths; between the trees bushes or vines,\n",
      "all fruit-bearing, now and then seats and little wayside fountains;\n",
      "everywhere flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’d better import some of these ladies and set ‘em to parking the\n",
      "United States,” I suggested. “Mighty nice place they’ve got here.” We\n",
      "rested a few moments by one of the fountains, tested the fruit that\n",
      "looked ripe, and went on, impressed, for all our gay bravado by the\n",
      "sense of quiet potency which lay about us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was evidently a people highly skilled, efficient, caring for their\n",
      "country as a florist cares for his costliest orchids. Under the soft\n",
      "brilliant blue of that clear sky, in the pleasant shade of those endless\n",
      "rows of trees, we walked unharmed, the placid silence broken only by the\n",
      "birds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently there lay before us at the foot of a long hill the town or\n",
      "village we were aiming for. We stopped and studied it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff drew a long breath. “I wouldn’t have believed a collection of\n",
      "houses could look so lovely,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They’ve got architects and landscape gardeners in plenty, that’s sure,”\n",
      " agreed Terry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was astonished myself. You see, I come from California, and there’s no\n",
      "country lovelier, but when it comes to towns--! I have often groaned\n",
      "at home to see the offensive mess man made in the face of nature, even\n",
      "though I’m no art sharp, like Jeff. But this place! It was built mostly\n",
      "of a sort of dull rose-colored stone, with here and there some clear\n",
      "white houses; and it lay abroad among the green groves and gardens like\n",
      "a broken rosary of pink coral.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those big white ones are public buildings evidently,” Terry declared.\n",
      "“This is no savage country, my friend. But no men? Boys, it behooves us\n",
      "to go forward most politely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The place had an odd look, more impressive as we approached. “It’s like\n",
      "an exposition.” “It’s too pretty to be true.” “Plenty of palaces, but\n",
      "where are the homes?” “Oh there are little ones enough--but--.” It\n",
      "certainly was different from any towns we had ever seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no dirt,” said Jeff suddenly. “There’s no smoke,” he added\n",
      "after a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no noise,” I offered; but Terry snubbed me--“That’s because\n",
      "they are laying low for us; we’d better be careful how we go in there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could induce him to stay out, however, so we walked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was beauty, order, perfect cleanness, and the pleasantest\n",
      "sense of home over it all. As we neared the center of the town the\n",
      "houses stood thicker, ran together as it were, grew into rambling\n",
      "palaces grouped among parks and open squares, something as college\n",
      "buildings stand in their quiet greens.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, turning a corner, we came into a broad paved space and\n",
      "saw before us a band of women standing close together in even order,\n",
      "evidently waiting for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stopped a moment and looked back. The street behind was closed by\n",
      "another band, marching steadily, shoulder to shoulder. We went\n",
      "on--there seemed no other way to go--and presently found ourselves quite\n",
      "surrounded by this close-massed multitude, women, all of them, but--\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not young. They were not old. They were not, in the girl\n",
      "sense, beautiful. They were not in the least ferocious. And yet, as I\n",
      "looked from face to face, calm, grave, wise, wholly unafraid, evidently\n",
      "assured and determined, I had the funniest feeling--a very early\n",
      "feeling--a feeling that I traced back and back in memory until I caught\n",
      "up with it at last. It was that sense of being hopelessly in the wrong\n",
      "that I had so often felt in early youth when my short legs’ utmost\n",
      "effort failed to overcome the fact that I was late to school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff felt it too; I could see he did. We felt like small boys, very\n",
      "small boys, caught doing mischief in some gracious lady’s house. But\n",
      "Terry showed no such consciousness. I saw his quick eyes darting here\n",
      "and there, estimating numbers, measuring distances, judging chances of\n",
      "escape. He examined the close ranks about us, reaching back far on every\n",
      "side, and murmured softly to me, “Every one of ‘em over forty as I’m a\n",
      "sinner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet they were not old women. Each was in the full bloom of rosy health,\n",
      "erect, serene, standing sure-footed and light as any pugilist. They had\n",
      "no weapons, and we had, but we had no wish to shoot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d as soon shoot my aunts,” muttered Terry again. “What do they\n",
      "want with us anyhow? They seem to mean business.” But in spite of that\n",
      "businesslike aspect, he determined to try his favorite tactics. Terry\n",
      "had come armed with a theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped forward, with his brilliant ingratiating smile, and made low\n",
      "obeisance to the women before him. Then he produced another tribute, a\n",
      "broad soft scarf of filmy texture, rich in color and pattern, a lovely\n",
      "thing, even to my eye, and offered it with a deep bow to the tall\n",
      "unsmiling woman who seemed to head the ranks before him. She took it\n",
      "with a gracious nod of acknowledgment, and passed it on to those behind\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried again, this time bringing out a circlet of rhinestones, a\n",
      "glittering crown that should have pleased any woman on earth. He made a\n",
      "brief address, including Jeff and me as partners in his enterprise, and\n",
      "with another bow presented this. Again his gift was accepted and, as\n",
      "before, passed out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If they were only younger,” he muttered between his teeth. “What on\n",
      "earth is a fellow to say to a regiment of old Colonels like this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "In all our discussions and speculations we had always unconsciously\n",
      "assumed that the women, whatever else they might be, would be young.\n",
      "Most men do think that way, I fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Woman” in the abstract is young, and, we assume, charming. As they get\n",
      "older they pass off the stage, somehow, into private ownership mostly,\n",
      "or out of it altogether. But these good ladies were very much on the\n",
      "stage, and yet any one of them might have been a grandmother.\n",
      "\n",
      "We looked for nervousness--there was none.\n",
      "\n",
      "For terror, perhaps--there was none.\n",
      "\n",
      "For uneasiness, for curiosity, for excitement--and all we saw was what\n",
      "might have been a vigilance committee of women doctors, as cool as\n",
      "cucumbers, and evidently meaning to take us to task for being there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six of them stepped forward now, one on either side of each of us, and\n",
      "indicated that we were to go with them. We thought it best to accede, at\n",
      "first anyway, and marched along, one of these close at each elbow, and\n",
      "the others in close masses before, behind, on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large building opened before us, a very heavy thick-walled impressive\n",
      "place, big, and old-looking; of gray stone, not like the rest of the\n",
      "town.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This won’t do!” said Terry to us, quickly. “We mustn’t let them get us\n",
      "in this, boys. All together, now--”\n",
      "\n",
      "We stopped in our tracks. We began to explain, to make signs pointing\n",
      "away toward the big forest--indicating that we would go back to it--at\n",
      "once.\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes me laugh, knowing all I do now, to think of us three\n",
      "boys--nothing else; three audacious impertinent boys--butting into an\n",
      "unknown country without any sort of a guard or defense. We seemed to\n",
      "think that if there were men we could fight them, and if there were only\n",
      "women--why, they would be no obstacles at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff, with his gentle romantic old-fashioned notions of women as\n",
      "clinging vines. Terry, with his clear decided practical theories that\n",
      "there were two kinds of women--those he wanted and those he didn’t;\n",
      "Desirable and Undesirable was his demarcation. The latter as a large\n",
      "class, but negligible--he had never thought about them at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now here they were, in great numbers, evidently indifferent to\n",
      "what he might think, evidently determined on some purpose of their own\n",
      "regarding him, and apparently well able to enforce their purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all thought hard just then. It had not seemed wise to object to going\n",
      "with them, even if we could have; our one chance was friendliness--a\n",
      "civilized attitude on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "But once inside that building, there was no knowing what these\n",
      "determined ladies might do to us. Even a peaceful detention was not to\n",
      "our minds, and when we named it imprisonment it looked even worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we made a stand, trying to make clear that we preferred the open\n",
      "country. One of them came forward with a sketch of our flier, asking by\n",
      "signs if we were the aerial visitors they had seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "This we admitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "They pointed to it again, and to the outlying country, in different\n",
      "directions--but we pretended we did not know where it was, and in\n",
      "truth we were not quite sure and gave a rather wild indication of its\n",
      "whereabouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again they motioned us to advance, standing so packed about the door\n",
      "that there remained but the one straight path open. All around us and\n",
      "behind they were massed solidly--there was simply nothing to do but go\n",
      "forward--or fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "We held a consultation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never fought with women in my life,” said Terry, greatly perturbed,\n",
      "“but I’m not going in there. I’m not going to be--herded in--as if we\n",
      "were in a cattle chute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can’t fight them, of course,” Jeff urged. “They’re all women,\n",
      "in spite of their nondescript clothes; nice women, too; good strong\n",
      "sensible faces. I guess we’ll have to go in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We may never get out, if we do,” I told them. “Strong and sensible,\n",
      "yes; but I’m not so sure about the good. Look at those faces!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They had stood at ease, waiting while we conferred together, but never\n",
      "relaxing their close attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their attitude was not the rigid discipline of soldiers; there was no\n",
      "sense of compulsion about them. Terry’s term of a “vigilance committee”\n",
      " was highly descriptive. They had just the aspect of sturdy burghers,\n",
      "gathered hastily to meet some common need or peril, all moved by\n",
      "precisely the same feelings, to the same end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never, anywhere before, had I seen women of precisely this quality.\n",
      "Fishwives and market women might show similar strength, but it was\n",
      "coarse and heavy. These were merely athletic--light and powerful.\n",
      "College professors, teachers, writers--many women showed similar\n",
      "intelligence but often wore a strained nervous look, while these were as\n",
      "calm as cows, for all their evident intellect.\n",
      "\n",
      "We observed pretty closely just then, for all of us felt that it was a\n",
      "crucial moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The leader gave some word of command and beckoned us on, and the\n",
      "surrounding mass moved a step nearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve got to decide quick,” said Terry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I vote to go in,” Jeff urged. But we were two to one against him and he\n",
      "loyally stood by us. We made one more effort to be let go, urgent, but\n",
      "not imploring. In vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now for a rush, boys!” Terry said. “And if we can’t break ‘em, I’ll\n",
      "shoot in the air.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we found ourselves much in the position of the suffragette trying\n",
      "to get to the Parliament buildings through a triple cordon of London\n",
      "police.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solidity of those women was something amazing. Terry soon found that\n",
      "it was useless, tore himself loose for a moment, pulled his revolver,\n",
      "and fired upward. As they caught at it, he fired again--we heard a\n",
      "cry--.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly each of us was seized by five women, each holding arm or leg\n",
      "or head; we were lifted like children, straddling helpless children, and\n",
      "borne onward, wriggling indeed, but most ineffectually.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were borne inside, struggling manfully, but held secure most\n",
      "womanfully, in spite of our best endeavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "So carried and so held, we came into a high inner hall, gray and bare,\n",
      "and were brought before a majestic gray-haired woman who seemed to hold\n",
      "a judicial position.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was some talk, not much, among them, and then suddenly there fell\n",
      "upon each of us at once a firm hand holding a wetted cloth before mouth\n",
      "and nose--an order of swimming sweetness--anesthesia.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From a slumber as deep as death, as refreshing as that of a healthy\n",
      "child, I slowly awakened.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was like rising up, up, up through a deep warm ocean, nearer\n",
      "and nearer to full light and stirring air. Or like the return to\n",
      "consciousness after concussion of the brain. I was once thrown from a\n",
      "horse while on a visit to a wild mountainous country quite new to me,\n",
      "and I can clearly remember the mental experience of coming back to life,\n",
      "through lifting veils of dream. When I first dimly heard the voices of\n",
      "those about me, and saw the shining snowpeaks of that mighty range, I\n",
      "assumed that this too would pass, and I should presently find myself in\n",
      "my own home.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was precisely the experience of this awakening: receding waves of\n",
      "half-caught swirling vision, memories of home, the steamer, the boat,\n",
      "the airship, the forest--at last all sinking away one after another,\n",
      "till my eyes were wide open, my brain clear, and I realized what had\n",
      "happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most prominent sensation was of absolute physical comfort. I was\n",
      "lying in a perfect bed: long, broad, smooth; firmly soft and level; with\n",
      "the finest linen, some warm light quilt of blanket, and a counterpane\n",
      "that was a joy to the eye. The sheet turned down some fifteen inches,\n",
      "yet I could stretch my feet at the foot of the bed free but warmly\n",
      "covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt as light and clean as a white feather. It took me some time to\n",
      "conscientiously locate my arms and legs, to feel the vivid sense of life\n",
      "radiate from the wakening center to the extremities.\n",
      "\n",
      "A big room, high and wide, with many lofty windows whose closed blinds\n",
      "let through soft green-lit air; a beautiful room, in proportion, in\n",
      "color, in smooth simplicity; a scent of blossoming gardens outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay perfectly still, quite happy, quite conscious, and yet not\n",
      "actively realizing what had happened till I heard Terry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gosh!” was what he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "I turned my head. There were three beds in this chamber, and plenty of\n",
      "room for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry was sitting up, looking about him, alert as ever. His remark,\n",
      "though not loud, roused Jeff also. We all sat up.\n",

      "Terry swung his legs out of bed, stood up, stretched himself mightily.\n",
      "He was in a long nightrobe, a sort of seamless garment, undoubtedly\n",
      "comfortable--we all found ourselves so covered. Shoes were beside each\n",
      "bed, also quite comfortable and goodlooking though by no means like our\n",
      "own.\n",

      "A door stood somewhat ajar; it opened into a most attractive bathroom,\n",
      "copiously provided with towels, soap, mirrors, and all such convenient\n",
      "comforts, with indeed our toothbrushes and combs, our notebooks, and\n",
      "thank goodness, our watches--but no clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we made a search of the big room again and found a large airy\n",
      "closet, holding plenty of clothing, but not ours.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A council of war!” demanded Terry. “Come on back to bed--the bed’s all\n",
      "right anyhow. Now then, my scientific friend, let us consider our case\n",
      "dispassionately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He meant me, but Jeff seemed most impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They haven’t hurt us in the least!” he said. “They could have killed\n",

      "\n",
      "“That argues that they are all women,” I suggested, “and highly\n",
      "civilized. You know you hit one in the last scrimmage--I heard her sing\n",
      "out--and we kicked awfully.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry was grinning at us. “So you realize what these ladies have done to\n",
      "us?” he pleasantly inquired. “They have taken away all our possessions,\n",
      "all our clothes--every stitch. We have been stripped and washed and put\n",
      "to bed like so many yearling babies--by these highly civilized women.”\n",

      "Jeff actually blushed. He had a poetic imagination. Terry had\n",
      "imagination enough, of a different kind. So had I, also different.\n",
      "I always flattered myself I had the scientific imagination, which,\n",
      "incidentally, I considered the highest sort. One has a right to a\n",
      "certain amount of egotism if founded on fact--and kept to one’s self--I\n",
      "think.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No use kicking, boys,” I said. “They’ve got us, and apparently they’re\n",
      "perfectly harmless. It remains for us to cook up some plan of escape\n",
      "like any other bottled heroes. Meanwhile we’ve got to put on these\n",
      "clothes--Hobson’s choice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The garments were simple in the extreme, and absolutely comfortable,\n",
      "physically, though of course we all felt like supes in the theater.\n",
      "There was a one-piece cotton undergarment, thin and soft, that reached\n",
      "over the knees and shoulders, something like the one-piece pajamas some\n",
      "fellows wear, and a kind of half-hose, that came up to just under the\n",
      "knee and stayed there--had elastic tops of their own, and covered the\n",
      "edges of the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was a thicker variety of union suit, a lot of them in the\n",
      "closet, of varying weights and somewhat sturdier material--evidently\n",
      "they would do at a pinch with nothing further. Then there were tunics,\n",
      "knee-length, and some long robes. Needless to say, we took tunics.\n",
      "\n",
      "We bathed and dressed quite cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not half bad,” said Terry, surveying himself in a long mirror. His\n",
      "hair was somewhat longer than when we left the last barber, and the\n",
      "hats provided were much like those seen on the prince in the fairy tale,\n",
      "lacking the plume.\n",
      "\n",
      "The costume was similar to that which we had seen on all the women,\n",

      "\n",
      "I settled my shoulders and stretched my arms, remarking: “They have\n",

      "we all agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now then,” Terry proclaimed, “we’ve had a fine long sleep--we’ve had a\n",
      "good bath--we’re clothed and in our right minds, though feeling like a\n",
      "lot of neuters. Do you think these highly civilized ladies are going to\n",
      "give us any breakfast?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course they will,” Jeff asserted confidently. “If they had meant to\n",
      "kill us, they would have done it before. I believe we are going to be\n",
      "treated as guests.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hailed as deliverers, I think,” said Terry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Studied as curiosities,” I told them. “But anyhow, we want food. So now\n",
      "for a sortie!”\n",
      "\n",
      "A sortie was not so easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bathroom only opened into our chamber, and that had but one outlet,\n",
      "a big heavy door, which was fastened.\n",
      "\n",
      "We listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s someone outside,” Jeff suggested. “Let’s knock.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So we knocked, whereupon the door opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside was another large room, furnished with a great table at one\n",
      "end, long benches or couches against the wall, some smaller tables\n",
      "and chairs. All these were solid, strong, simple in structure, and\n",
      "comfortable in use--also, incidentally, beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "This room was occupied by a number of women, eighteen to be exact, some\n",
      "of whom we distinctly recalled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry heaved a disappointed sigh. “The Colonels!” I heard him whisper to\n",
      "Jeff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff, however, advanced and bowed in his best manner; so did we all, and\n",
      "we were saluted civilly by the tall-standing women.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had no need to make pathetic pantomime of hunger; the smaller tables\n",
      "were already laid with food, and we were gravely invited to be seated.\n",
      "The tables were set for two; each of us found ourselves placed vis-a-vis\n",
      "with one of our hosts, and each table had five other stalwarts nearby,\n",
      "unobtrusively watching. We had plenty of time to get tired of those\n",
      "women!\n",
      "\n",
      "The breakfast was not profuse, but sufficient in amount and excellent in\n",
      "quality. We were all too good travelers to object to novelty, and this\n",
      "repast with its new but delicious fruit, its dish of large rich-flavored\n",
      "nuts, and its highly satisfactory little cakes was most agreeable. There\n",
      "was water to drink, and a hot beverage of a most pleasing quality, some\n",
      "preparation like cocoa.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then and there, willy-nilly, before we had satisfied our appetites,\n",
      "our education began.\n",
      "\n",
      "By each of our plates lay a little book, a real printed book, though\n",
      "different from ours both in paper and binding, as well, of course, as in\n",
      "type. We examined them curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shades of Sauveur!” muttered Terry. “We’re to learn the language!”\n",
      "\n",
      "We were indeed to learn the language, and not only that, but to teach\n",
      "our own. There were blank books with parallel columns, neatly ruled,\n",
      "evidently prepared for the occasion, and in these, as fast as we learned\n",
      "and wrote down the name of anything, we were urged to write our own name\n",
      "for it by its side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book we had to study was evidently a schoolbook, one in which\n",
      "children learned to read, and we judged from this, and from their\n",
      "frequent consultation as to methods, that they had had no previous\n",
      "experience in the art of teaching foreigners their language, or of\n",
      "learning any other.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, what they lacked in experience, they made up for\n",
      "in genius. Such subtle understanding, such instant recognition of our\n",
      "difficulties, and readiness to meet them, were a constant surprise to\n",
      "us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, we were willing to meet them halfway. It was wholly to\n",
      "our advantage to be able to understand and speak with them, and as\n",
      "to refusing to teach them--why should we? Later on we did try open\n",
      "rebellion, but only once.\n",
      "\n",
      "That first meal was pleasant enough, each of us quietly studying\n",
      "his companion, Jeff with sincere admiration, Terry with that highly\n",
      "technical look of his, as of a past master--like a lion tamer, a serpent\n",
      "charmer, or some such professional. I myself was intensely interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evident that those sets of five were there to check any outbreak\n",
      "on our part. We had no weapons, and if we did try to do any damage, with\n",
      "a chair, say, why five to one was too many for us, even if they were\n",
      "women; that we had found out to our sorrow. It was not pleasant, having\n",
      "them always around, but we soon got used to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s better than being physically restrained ourselves,” Jeff\n",
      "philosophically suggested when we were alone. “They’ve given us a\n",
      "room--with no great possibility of escape--and personal liberty--heavily\n",
      "chaperoned. It’s better than we’d have been likely to get in a\n",
      "man-country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man-Country! Do you really believe there are no men here, you innocent?\n",
      "Don’t you know there must be?” demanded Terry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ye--es,” Jeff agreed. “Of course--and yet--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet--what! Come, you obdurate sentimentalist--what are you thinking\n",
      "about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They may have some peculiar division of labor we’ve never heard of,” I\n",
      "suggested. “The men may live in separate towns, or they may have subdued\n",
      "them--somehow--and keep them shut up. But there must be some.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That last suggestion of yours is a nice one, Van,” Terry protested.\n",
      "“Same as they’ve got us subdued and shut up! you make me shiver.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, figure it out for yourself, anyway you please. We saw plenty of\n",
      "kids, the first day, and we’ve seen those girls--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Real girls!” Terry agreed, in immense relief. “Glad you mentioned\n",
      "‘em. I declare, if I thought there was nothing in the country but those\n",
      "grenadiers I’d jump out the window.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speaking of windows,” I suggested, “let’s examine ours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We looked out of all the windows. The blinds opened easily enough, and\n",
      "there were no bars, but the prospect was not reassuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not the pink-walled town we had so rashly entered the day\n",
      "before. Our chamber was high up, in a projecting wing of a sort of\n",
      "castle, built out on a steep spur of rock. Immediately below us were\n",
      "gardens, fruitful and fragrant, but their high walls followed the edge\n",
      "of the cliff which dropped sheer down, we could not see how far. The\n",
      "distant sound of water suggested a river at the foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could look out east, west, and south. To the southeastward stretched\n",
      "the open country, lying bright and fair in the morning light, but on\n",
      "either side, and evidently behind, rose great mountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This thing is a regular fortress--and no women built it, I can tell\n",
      "you that,” said Terry. We nodded agreeingly. “It’s right up among the\n",
      "hills--they must have brought us a long way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We saw some kind of swift-moving vehicles the first day,” Jeff reminded\n",
      "us. “If they’ve got motors, they ARE civilized.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Civilized or not, we’ve got our work cut out for us to get away from\n",
      "here. I don’t propose to make a rope of bedclothes and try those walls\n",
      "till I’m sure there is no better way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We all concurred on this point, and returned to our discussion as to the\n",
      "women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff continued thoughtful. “All the same, there’s something funny about\n",
      "it,” he urged. “It isn’t just that we don’t see any men--but we don’t\n",
      "see any signs of them. The--the--reaction of these women is different\n",
      "from any that I’ve ever met.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is something in what you say, Jeff,” I agreed. “There is a\n",
      "different--atmosphere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They don’t seem to notice our being men,” he went on. “They treat\n",
      "us--well--just as they do one another. It’s as if our being men was a\n",
      "minor incident.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I nodded. I’d noticed it myself. But Terry broke in rudely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fiddlesticks!” he said. “It’s because of their advanced age. They’re\n",
      "all grandmas, I tell you--or ought to be. Great aunts, anyhow. Those\n",
      "girls were girls all right, weren’t they?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--” Jeff agreed, still slowly. “But they weren’t afraid--they flew\n",
      "up that tree and hid, like schoolboys caught out of bounds--not like shy\n",
      "girls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And they ran like marathon winners--you’ll admit that, Terry,” he\n",
      "added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry was moody as the days passed. He seemed to mind our confinement\n",
      "more than Jeff or I did; and he harped on Alima, and how near he’d come\n",
      "to catching her. “If I had--” he would say, rather savagely, “we’d have\n",
      "had a hostage and could have made terms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jeff was getting on excellent terms with his tutor, and even his\n",
      "guards, and so was I. It interested me profoundly to note and study\n",
      "the subtle difference between these women and other women, and try to\n",
      "account for them. In the matter of personal appearance, there was a\n",
      "great difference. They all wore short hair, some few inches at most;\n",
      "some curly, some not; all light and clean and fresh-looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If their hair was only long,” Jeff would complain, “they would look so\n",
      "much more feminine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I rather liked it myself, after I got used to it. Why we should so\n",
      "admire “a woman’s crown of hair” and not admire a Chinaman’s queue is\n",
      "hard to explain, except that we are so convinced that the long hair\n",
      "“belongs” to a woman. Whereas the “mane” in horses is on both, and in\n",
      "lions, buffalos, and such creatures only on the male. But I did miss\n",
      "it--at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our time was quite pleasantly filled. We were free of the garden below\n",
      "our windows, quite long in its irregular rambling shape, bordering the\n",
      "cliff. The walls were perfectly smooth and high, ending in the masonry\n",
      "of the building; and as I studied the great stones I became convinced\n",
      "that the whole structure was extremely old. It was built like the\n",
      "pre-Incan architecture in Peru, of enormous monoliths, fitted as closely\n",
      "as mosaics.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These folks have a history, that’s sure,” I told the others. “And SOME\n",
      "time they were fighters--else why a fortress?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said we were free of the garden, but not wholly alone in it. There\n",
      "was always a string of those uncomfortably strong women sitting about,\n",
      "always one of them watching us even if the others were reading, playing\n",
      "games, or busy at some kind of handiwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I see them knit,” Terry said, “I can almost call them feminine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That doesn’t prove anything,” Jeff promptly replied. “Scotch shepherds\n",
      "knit--always knitting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When we get out--” Terry stretched himself and looked at the far\n",
      "peaks, “when we get out of this and get to where the real women are--the\n",
      "mothers, and the girls--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, what’ll we do then?” I asked, rather gloomily. “How do you know\n",
      "we’ll ever get out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was an unpleasant idea, which we unanimously considered, returning\n",
      "with earnestness to our studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we are good boys and learn our lessons well,” I suggested. “If we\n",
      "are quiet and respectful and polite and they are not afraid of us--then\n",
      "perhaps they will let us out. And anyway--when we do escape, it is of\n",
      "immense importance that we know the language.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I was tremendously interested in that language, and seeing\n",
      "they had books, was eager to get at them, to dig into their history, if\n",
      "they had one.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not hard to speak, smooth and pleasant to the ear, and so easy\n",
      "to read and write that I marveled at it. They had an absolutely phonetic\n",
      "system, the whole thing was as scientific as Esparanto yet bore all the\n",
      "marks of an old and rich civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were free to study as much as we wished, and were not left merely to\n",
      "wander in the garden for recreation but introduced to a great gymnasium,\n",
      "partly on the roof and partly in the story below. Here we learned real\n",
      "respect for our tall guards. No change of costume was needed for this\n",
      "work, save to lay off outer clothing. The first one was as perfect a\n",
      "garment for exercise as need be devised, absolutely free to move in,\n",
      "and, I had to admit, much better-looking than our usual one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forty--over forty--some of ‘em fifty, I bet--and look at ‘em!” grumbled\n",
      "Terry in reluctant admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no spectacular acrobatics, such as only the young can\n",
      "perform, but for all-around development they had a most excellent\n",
      "system. A good deal of music went with it, with posture dancing and,\n",
      "sometimes, gravely beautiful processional performances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff was much impressed by it. We did not know then how small a part of\n",
      "their physical culture methods this really was, but found it agreeable\n",
      "to watch, and to take part in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yes, we took part all right! It wasn’t absolutely compulsory, but we\n",
      "thought it better to please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry was the strongest of us, though I was wiry and had good staying\n",
      "power, and Jeff was a great sprinter and hurdler, but I can tell you\n",
      "those old ladies gave us cards and spades. They ran like deer, by which\n",
      "I mean that they ran not as if it was a performance, but as if it was\n",
      "their natural gait. We remembered those fleeting girls of our first\n",
      "bright adventure, and concluded that it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "They leaped like deer, too, with a quick folding motion of the legs,\n",
      "drawn up and turned to one side with a sidelong twist of the body. I\n",
      "remembered the sprawling spread-eagle way in which some of the fellows\n",
      "used to come over the line--and tried to learn the trick. We did not\n",
      "easily catch up with these experts, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never thought I’d live to be bossed by a lot of elderly lady acrobats,”\n",
      " Terry protested.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had games, too, a good many of them, but we found them rather\n",
      "uninteresting at first. It was like two people playing solitaire to\n",
      "see who would get it first; more like a race or a--a competitive\n",
      "examination, than a real game with some fight in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I philosophized a bit over this and told Terry it argued against their\n",
      "having any men about. “There isn’t a man-size game in the lot,” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But they are interesting--I like them,” Jeff objected, “and I’m sure\n",
      "they are educational.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sick and tired of being educated,” Terry protested. “Fancy going to\n",
      "a dame school--at our age. I want to Get Out!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But we could not get out, and we were being educated swiftly. Our\n",
      "special tutors rose rapidly in our esteem. They seemed of rather finer\n",
      "quality than the guards, though all were on terms of easy friendliness.\n",
      "Mine was named Somel, Jeff’s Zava, and Terry’s Moadine. We tried to\n",
      "generalize from the names, those of the guards, and of our three girls,\n",
      "but got nowhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They sound well enough, and they’re mostly short, but there’s no\n",
      "similarity of termination--and no two alike. However, our acquaintance\n",
      "is limited as yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There were many things we meant to ask--as soon as we could talk well\n",
      "enough. Better teaching I never saw. From morning to night there was\n",
      "Somel, always on call except between two and four; always pleasant with\n",
      "a steady friendly kindness that I grew to enjoy very much. Jeff said\n",
      "Miss Zava--he would put on a title, though they apparently had none--was\n",
      "a darling, that she reminded him of his Aunt Esther at home; but Terry\n",
      "refused to be won, and rather jeered at his own companion, when we were\n",
      "alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sick of it!” he protested. “Sick of the whole thing. Here we are\n",
      "cooped up as helpless as a bunch of three-year-old orphans, and being\n",
      "taught what they think is necessary--whether we like it or not. Confound\n",
      "their old-maid impudence!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless we were taught. They brought in a raised map of their\n",
      "country, beautifully made, and increased our knowledge of geographical\n",
      "terms; but when we inquired for information as to the country outside,\n",
      "they smilingly shook their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "They brought pictures, not only the engravings in the books but colored\n",
      "studies of plants and trees and flowers and birds. They brought tools\n",
      "and various small objects--we had plenty of “material” in our school.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it had not been for Terry we would have been much more contented, but\n",
      "as the weeks ran into months he grew more and more irritable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t act like a bear with a sore head,” I begged him. “We’re getting\n",
      "on finely. Every day we can understand them better, and pretty soon we\n",
      "can make a reasonable plea to be let out--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“LET out!” he stormed. “LET out--like children kept after school. I want\n",
      "to Get Out, and I’m going to. I want to find the men of this place and\n",
      "fight!--or the girls--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Guess it’s the girls you’re most interested in,” Jeff commented. “What\n",
      "are you going to fight WITH--your fists?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--or sticks and stones--I’d just like to!” And Terry squared off and\n",
      "tapped Jeff softly on the jaw. “Just for instance,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anyhow,” he went on, “we could get back to our machine and clear out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it’s there,” I cautiously suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t croak, Van! If it isn’t there, we’ll find our way down\n",
      "somehow--the boat’s there, I guess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was hard on Terry, so hard that he finally persuaded us to consider\n",
      "a plan of escape. It was difficult, it was highly dangerous, but he\n",
      "declared that he’d go alone if we wouldn’t go with him, and of course we\n",
      "couldn’t think of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared he had made a pretty careful study of the environment. From\n",
      "our end window that faced the point of the promontory we could get a\n",
      "fair idea of the stretch of wall, and the drop below. Also from the roof\n",
      "we could make out more, and even, in one place, glimpse a sort of path\n",
      "below the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a question of three things,” he said. “Ropes, agility, and not\n",
      "being seen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the hardest part,” I urged, still hoping to dissuade him. “One\n",
      "or another pair of eyes is on us every minute except at night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Therefore we must do it at night,” he answered. “That’s easy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve got to think that if they catch us we may not be so well treated\n",
      "afterward,” said Jeff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the business risk we must take. I’m going--if I break my neck.”\n",
      " There was no changing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rope problem was not easy. Something strong enough to hold a man and\n",
      "long enough to let us down into the garden, and then down over the wall.\n",
      "There were plenty of strong ropes in the gymnasium--they seemed to love\n",
      "to swing and climb on them--but we were never there by ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should have to piece it out from our bedding, rugs, and garments, and\n",
      "moreover, we should have to do it after we were shut in for the\n",
      "night, for every day the place was cleaned to perfection by two of our\n",
      "guardians.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had no shears, no knives, but Terry was resourceful. “These Jennies\n",
      "have glass and china, you see. We’ll break a glass from the bathroom and\n",
      "use that. ‘Love will find out a way,’” he hummed. “When we’re all out of\n",
      "the window, we’ll stand three-man high and cut the rope as far up as we\n",
      "can reach, so as to have more for the wall. I know just where I saw\n",
      "that bit of path below, and there’s a big tree there, too, or a vine or\n",
      "something--I saw the leaves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed a crazy risk to take, but this was, in a way, Terry’s\n",
      "expedition, and we were all tired of our imprisonment.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we waited for full moon, retired early, and spent an anxious hour or\n",
      "two in the unskilled manufacture of man-strong ropes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To retire into the depths of the closet, muffle a glass in thick cloth,\n",
      "and break it without noise was not difficult, and broken glass will cut,\n",
      "though not as deftly as a pair of scissors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The broad moonlight streamed in through four of our windows--we had not\n",
      "dared leave our lights on too long--and we worked hard and fast at our\n",
      "task of destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hangings, rugs, robes, towels, as well as bed-furniture--even the\n",
      "mattress covers--we left not one stitch upon another, as Jeff put it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then at an end window, as less liable to observation, we fastened one\n",
      "end of our cable, strongly, to the firm-set hinge of the inner blind,\n",
      "and dropped our coiled bundle of rope softly over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This part’s easy enough--I’ll come last, so as to cut the rope,” said\n",
      "Terry.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I slipped down first, and stood, well braced against the wall; then\n",
      "Jeff on my shoulders, then Terry, who shook us a little as he sawed\n",
      "through the cord above his head. Then I slowly dropped to the ground,\n",
      "Jeff following, and at last we all three stood safe in the garden, with\n",
      "most of our rope with us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-bye, Grandma!” whispered Terry, under his breath, and we crept\n",
      "softly toward the wall, taking advantage of the shadow of every bush\n",
      "and tree. He had been foresighted enough to mark the very spot, only a\n",
      "scratch of stone on stone, but we could see to read in that light. For\n",
      "anchorage there was a tough, fair-sized shrub close to the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now I’ll climb up on you two again and go over first,” said Terry.\n",
      "“That’ll hold the rope firm till you both get up on top. Then I’ll go\n",
      "down to the end. If I can get off safely, you can see me and follow--or,\n",
      "say, I’ll twitch it three times. If I find there’s absolutely no\n",
      "footing--why I’ll climb up again, that’s all. I don’t think they’ll kill\n",
      "us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "From the top he reconnoitered carefully, waved his hand, and whispered,\n",
      "“OK,” then slipped over. Jeff climbed up and I followed, and we rather\n",
      "shivered to see how far down that swaying, wavering figure dropped, hand\n",
      "under hand, till it disappeared in a mass of foliage far below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there were three quick pulls, and Jeff and I, not without a joyous\n",
      "sense of recovered freedom, successfully followed our leader.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were standing on a narrow, irregular, all too slanting little ledge,\n",
      "and should doubtless have ignominiously slipped off and broken our rash\n",
      "necks but for the vine. This was a thick-leaved, wide-spreading thing, a\n",
      "little like Amphelopsis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not QUITE vertical here, you see,” said Terry, full of pride and\n",
      "enthusiasm. “This thing never would hold our direct weight, but I think\n",
      "if we sort of slide down on it, one at a time, sticking in with hands\n",
      "and feet, we’ll reach that next ledge alive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As we do not wish to get up our rope again--and can’t comfortably stay\n",
      "here--I approve,” said Jeff solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry slid down first--said he’d show us how a Christian meets\n",
      "his death. Luck was with us. We had put on the thickest of those\n",
      "intermediate suits, leaving our tunics behind, and made this scramble\n",
      "quite successfully, though I got a pretty heavy fall just at the end,\n",
      "and was only kept on the second ledge by main force. The next stage\n",
      "was down a sort of “chimney”--a long irregular fissure; and so with\n",
      "scratches many and painful and bruises not a few, we finally reached the\n",
      "stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was darker there, but we felt it highly necessary to put as much\n",
      "distance as possible behind us; so we waded, jumped, and clambered down\n",
      "that rocky riverbed, in the flickering black and white moonlight and\n",
      "leaf shadow, till growing daylight forced a halt.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found a friendly nut-tree, those large, satisfying, soft-shelled nuts\n",
      "we already knew so well, and filled our pockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see that I have not remarked that these women had pockets in\n",
      "surprising number and variety. They were in all their garments, and the\n",
      "middle one in particular was shingled with them. So we stocked up with\n",
      "nuts till we bulged like Prussian privates in marching order, drank all\n",
      "we could hold, and retired for the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a very comfortable place, not at all easy to get at, just\n",
      "a sort of crevice high up along the steep bank, but it was well veiled\n",
      "with foliage and dry. After our exhaustive three- or four-hour scramble\n",
      "and the good breakfast food, we all lay down along that crack--heads and\n",
      "tails, as it were--and slept till the afternoon sun almost toasted our\n",
      "faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry poked a tentative foot against my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you, Van? Alive yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much so,” I told him. And Jeff was equally cheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had room to stretch, if not to turn around; but we could very\n",
      "carefully roll over, one at a time, behind the sheltering foliage.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was no use to leave there by daylight. We could not see much of the\n",
      "country, but enough to know that we were now at the beginning of the\n",
      "cultivated area, and no doubt there would be an alarm sent out far and\n",
      "wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry chuckled softly to himself, lying there on that hot narrow little\n",
      "rim of rock. He dilated on the discomfiture of our guards and tutors,\n",
      "making many discourteous remarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reminded him that we had still a long way to go before getting to\n",
      "the place where we’d left our machine, and no probability of finding it\n",
      "there; but he only kicked me, mildly, for a croaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you can’t boost, don’t knock,” he protested. “I never said ‘twould\n",
      "be a picnic. But I’d run away in the Antarctic ice fields rather than be\n",
      "a prisoner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We soon dozed off again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long rest and penetrating dry heat were good for us, and that night\n",
      "we covered a considerable distance, keeping always in the rough forested\n",
      "belt of land which we knew bordered the whole country. Sometimes we were\n",
      "near the outer edge, and caught sudden glimpses of the tremendous depths\n",
      "beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This piece of geography stands up like a basalt column,” Jeff said.\n",
      "“Nice time we’ll have getting down if they have confiscated our\n",
      "machine!” For which suggestion he received summary chastisement.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we could see inland was peaceable enough, but only moonlit\n",
      "glimpses; by daylight we lay very close. As Terry said, we did not wish\n",
      "to kill the old ladies--even if we could; and short of that they\n",
      "were perfectly competent to pick us up bodily and carry us back, if\n",
      "discovered. There was nothing for it but to lie low, and sneak out\n",
      "unseen if we could do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There wasn’t much talking done. At night we had our marathon-obstacle\n",
      "race; we “stayed not for brake and we stopped not for stone,” and swam\n",
      "whatever water was too deep to wade and could not be got around; but\n",
      "that was only necessary twice. By day, sleep, sound and sweet. Mighty\n",
      "lucky it was that we could live off the country as we did. Even that\n",
      "margin of forest seemed rich in foodstuffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jeff thoughtfully suggested that that very thing showed how careful\n",
      "we should have to be, as we might run into some stalwart group of\n",
      "gardeners or foresters or nut-gatherers at any minute. Careful we were,\n",
      "feeling pretty sure that if we did not make good this time we were not\n",
      "likely to have another opportunity; and at last we reached a point from\n",
      "which we could see, far below, the broad stretch of that still lake from\n",
      "which we had made our ascent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That looks pretty good to me!” said Terry, gazing down at it. “Now, if\n",
      "we can’t find the ‘plane, we know where to aim if we have to drop over\n",
      "this wall some other way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wall at that point was singularly uninviting. It rose so straight\n",
      "that we had to put our heads over to see the base, and the country below\n",
      "seemed to be a far-off marshy tangle of rank vegetation. We did not have\n",
      "to risk our necks to that extent, however, for at last, stealing along\n",
      "among the rocks and trees like so many creeping savages, we came to that\n",
      "flat space where we had landed; and there, in unbelievable good fortune,\n",
      "we found our machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Covered, too, by jingo! Would you think they had that much sense?”\n",
      " cried Terry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If they had that much, they’re likely to have more,” I warned him,\n",
      "softly. “Bet you the thing’s watched.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We reconnoitered as widely as we could in the failing moonlight--moons\n",
      "are of a painfully unreliable nature; but the growing dawn showed us\n",
      "the familiar shape, shrouded in some heavy cloth like canvas, and no\n",
      "slightest sign of any watchman near. We decided to make a quick dash as\n",
      "soon as the light was strong enough for accurate work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t care if the old thing’ll go or not,” Terry declared. “We can\n",
      "run her to the edge, get aboard, and just plane down--plop!--beside our\n",
      "boat there. Look there--see the boat!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure enough--there was our motor, lying like a gray cocoon on the flat\n",
      "pale sheet of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quietly but swiftly we rushed forward and began to tug at the fastenings\n",
      "of that cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Confound the thing!” Terry cried in desperate impatience. “They’ve got\n",
      "it sewed up in a bag! And we’ve not a knife among us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as we tugged and pulled at that tough cloth we heard a sound that\n",
      "made Terry lift his head like a war horse--the sound of an unmistakable\n",
      "giggle, yes--three giggles.\n",
      "\n",
      "There they were--Celis, Alima, Ellador--looking just as they had when\n",
      "we first saw them, standing a little way off from us, as interested, as\n",
      "mischievous as three schoolboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on, Terry--hold on!” I warned. “That’s too easy. Look out for a\n",
      "trap.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us appeal to their kind hearts,” Jeff urged. “I think they will\n",
      "help us. Perhaps they’ve got knives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s no use rushing them, anyhow,” I was absolutely holding on to\n",
      "Terry. “We know they can out-run and out-climb us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He reluctantly admitted this; and after a brief parley among ourselves,\n",
      "we all advanced slowly toward them, holding out our hands in token of\n",
      "friendliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "They stood their ground till we had come fairly near, and then indicated\n",
      "that we should stop. To make sure, we advanced a step or two and they\n",
      "promptly and swiftly withdrew. So we stopped at the distance specified.\n",
      "Then we used their language, as far as we were able, to explain our\n",
      "plight, telling how we were imprisoned, how we had escaped--a good deal\n",
      "of pantomime here and vivid interest on their part--how we had traveled\n",
      "by night and hidden by day, living on nuts--and here Terry pretended\n",
      "great hunger.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know he could not have been hungry; we had found plenty to eat and\n",
      "had not been sparing in helping ourselves. But they seemed somewhat\n",
      "impressed; and after a murmured consultation they produced from their\n",
      "pockets certain little packages, and with the utmost ease and accuracy\n",
      "tossed them into our hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff was most appreciative of this; and Terry made extravagant gestures\n",
      "of admiration, which seemed to set them off, boy-fashion, to show their\n",
      "skill. While we ate the excellent biscuits they had thrown us, and while\n",
      "Ellador kept a watchful eye on our movements, Celis ran off to some\n",
      "distance, and set up a sort of “duck-on-a-rock” arrangement, a big\n",
      "yellow nut on top of three balanced sticks; Alima, meanwhile, gathering\n",
      "stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "They urged us to throw at it, and we did, but the thing was a long way\n",
      "off, and it was only after a number of failures, at which those elvish\n",
      "damsels laughed delightedly, that Jeff succeeded in bringing the whole\n",
      "structure to the ground. It took me still longer, and Terry, to his\n",
      "intense annoyance, came third.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Celis set up the little tripod again, and looked back at us,\n",
      "knocking it down, pointing at it, and shaking her short curls severely.\n",
      "“No,” she said. “Bad--wrong!” We were quite able to follow her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she set it up once more, put the fat nut on top, and returned\n",
      "to the others; and there those aggravating girls sat and took turns\n",
      "throwing little stones at that thing, while one stayed by as a\n",
      "setter-up; and they just popped that nut off, two times out of three,\n",
      "without upsetting the sticks. Pleased as Punch they were, too, and we\n",
      "pretended to be, but weren’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got very friendly over this game, but I told Terry we’d be sorry if\n",
      "we didn’t get off while we could, and then we begged for knives. It was\n",
      "easy to show what we wanted to do, and they each proudly produced a sort\n",
      "of strong clasp-knife from their pockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” we said eagerly, “that’s it! Please--” We had learned quite a\n",
      "bit of their language, you see. And we just begged for those knives, but\n",
      "they would not give them to us. If we came a step too near they backed\n",
      "off, standing light and eager for flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s no sort of use,” I said. “Come on--let’s get a sharp stone or\n",
      "something--we must get this thing off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So we hunted about and found what edged fragments we could, and hacked\n",
      "away, but it was like trying to cut sailcloth with a clamshell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry hacked and dug, but said to us under his breath. “Boys, we’re in\n",
      "pretty good condition--let’s make a life and death dash and get hold of\n",
      "those girls--we’ve got to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They had drawn rather nearer to watch our efforts, and we did take\n",
      "them rather by surprise; also, as Terry said, our recent training had\n",
      "strengthened us in wind and limb, and for a few desperate moments those\n",
      "girls were scared and we almost triumphant.\n",
      "\n",
      "But just as we stretched out our hands, the distance between us widened;\n",
      "they had got their pace apparently, and then, though we ran at our\n",
      "utmost speed, and much farther than I thought wise, they kept just out\n",
      "of reach all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stopped breathless, at last, at my repeated admonitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is stark foolishness,” I urged. “They are doing it on\n",
      "purpose--come back or you’ll be sorry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We went back, much slower than we came, and in truth we were sorry.\n",

      "It was no use to fight. These women evidently relied on numbers, not so\n",
      "much as a drilled force but as a multitude actuated by a common impulse.\n",
      "They showed no sign of fear, and since we had no weapons whatever and\n",
      "there were at least a hundred of them, standing ten deep about us, we\n",
      "gave in as gracefully as we might.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course we looked for punishment--a closer imprisonment, solitary\n",
      "confinement maybe--but nothing of the kind happened. They treated us as\n",

      "Back we went, not under an anesthetic this time but skimming along in\n",

      "in a separate vehicle with one able-bodied lady on either side and three\n",
      "facing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all pleasant enough, and talked to us as much as was possible\n",
      "with our limited powers. And though Terry was keenly mortified, and at\n",
      "first we all rather dreaded harsh treatment, I for one soon began to\n",
      "feel a sort of pleasant confidence and to enjoy the trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here were my five familiar companions, all good-natured as could be,\n",
      "seeming to have no worse feeling than a mild triumph as of winning some\n",
      "simple game; and even that they politely suppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a good opportunity to see the country, too, and the more I saw\n",
      "of it, the better I liked it. We went too swiftly for close observation,\n",
      "but I could appreciate perfect roads, as dustless as a swept floor; the\n",
      "shade of endless lines of trees; the ribbon of flowers that unrolled\n",
      "beneath them; and the rich comfortable country that stretched off and\n",
      "away, full of varied charm.\n",
      "\n",
      "We rolled through many villages and towns, and I soon saw that the\n",
      "parklike beauty of our first-seen city was no exception. Our swift\n",
      "high-sweeping view from the ‘plane had been most attractive, but lacked\n",
      "detail; and in that first day of struggle and capture, we noticed\n",
      "little. But now we were swept along at an easy rate of some thirty miles\n",
      "an hour and covered quite a good deal of ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stopped for lunch in quite a sizable town, and here, rolling slowly\n",
      "through the streets, we saw more of the population. They had come out\n",
      "to look at us everywhere we had passed, but here were more; and when we\n",
      "went in to eat, in a big garden place with little shaded tables among\n",
      "the trees and flowers, many eyes were upon us. And everywhere, open\n",
      "country, village, or city--only women. Old women and young women and a\n",
      "great majority who seemed neither young nor old, but just women; young\n",
      "girls, also, though these, and the children, seeming to be in groups by\n",
      "themselves generally, were less in evidence. We caught many glimpses of\n",
      "girls and children in what seemed to be schools or in playgrounds, and\n",
      "so far as we could judge there were no boys. We all looked, carefully.\n",
      "Everyone gazed at us politely, kindly, and with eager interest. No one\n",
      "was impertinent. We could catch quite a bit of the talk now, and all\n",
      "they said seemed pleasant enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well--before nightfall we were all safely back in our big room. The\n",
      "damage we had done was quite ignored; the beds as smooth and comfortable\n",
      "as before, new clothing and towels supplied. The only thing those women\n",
      "did was to illuminate the gardens at night, and to set an extra watch.\n",
      "But they called us to account next day. Our three tutors, who had not\n",
      "joined in the recapturing expedition, had been quite busy in preparing\n",
      "for us, and now made explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "They knew well we would make for our machine, and also that there was no\n",
      "other way of getting down--alive. So our flight had troubled no one; all\n",
      "they did was to call the inhabitants to keep an eye on our movements all\n",
      "along the edge of the forest between the two points. It appeared that\n",
      "many of those nights we had been seen, by careful ladies sitting snugly\n",
      "in big trees by the riverbed, or up among the rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry looked immensely disgusted, but it struck me as extremely funny.\n",
      "Here we had been risking our lives, hiding and prowling like outlaws,\n",
      "living on nuts and fruit, getting wet and cold at night, and dry and hot\n",
      "by day, and all the while these estimable women had just been waiting\n",
      "for us to come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now they began to explain, carefully using such words as we could\n",
      "understand. It appeared that we were considered as guests of the\n",
      "country--sort of public wards. Our first violence had made it necessary\n",
      "to keep us safeguarded for a while, but as soon as we learned the\n",
      "language--and would agree to do no harm--they would show us all about\n",
      "the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff was eager to reassure them. Of course he did not tell on Terry, but\n",
      "he made it clear that he was ashamed of himself, and that he would now\n",
      "conform. As to the language--we all fell upon it with redoubled energy.\n",
      "They brought us books, in greater numbers, and I began to study them\n",
      "seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pretty punk literature,” Terry burst forth one day, when we were in\n",
      "the privacy of our own room. “Of course one expects to begin on\n",
      "child-stories, but I would like something more interesting now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t expect stirring romance and wild adventure without men, can you?”\n",
      " I asked. Nothing irritated Terry more than to have us assume that there\n",
      "were no men; but there were no signs of them in the books they gave us,\n",
      "or the pictures.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut up!” he growled. “What infernal nonsense you talk! I’m going to\n",
      "ask ‘em outright--we know enough now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth we had been using our best efforts to master the language, and\n",
      "were able to read fluently and to discuss what we read with considerable\n",
      "ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "That afternoon we were all sitting together on the roof--we three and\n",
      "the tutors gathered about a table, no guards about. We had been made to\n",
      "understand some time earlier that if we would agree to do no violence\n",
      "they would withdraw their constant attendance, and we promised most\n",
      "willingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So there we sat, at ease; all in similar dress; our hair, by now, as\n",
      "long as theirs, only our beards to distinguish us. We did not want those\n",
      "beards, but had so far been unable to induce them to give us any cutting\n",
      "instruments.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ladies,” Terry began, out of a clear sky, as it were, “are there no men\n",
      "in this country?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Men?” Somel answered. “Like you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, men,” Terry indicated his beard, and threw back his broad\n",
      "shoulders. “Men, real men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” she answered quietly. “There are no men in this country. There has\n",
      "not been a man among us for two thousand years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her look was clear and truthful and she did not advance this astonishing\n",
      "statement as if it was astonishing, but quite as a matter of fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But--the people--the children,” he protested, not believing her in the\n",
      "least, but not wishing to say so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes,” she smiled. “I do not wonder you are puzzled. We are\n",
      "mothers--all of us--but there are no fathers. We thought you would ask\n",
      "about that long ago--why have you not?” Her look was as frankly kind as\n",
      "always, her tone quite simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry explained that we had not felt sufficiently used to the language,\n",
      "making rather a mess of it, I thought, but Jeff was franker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you excuse us all,” he said, “if we admit that we find it hard to\n",
      "believe? There is no such--possibility--in the rest of the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you no kind of life where it is possible?” asked Zava.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, yes--some low forms, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How low--or how high, rather?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well--there are some rather high forms of insect life in which it\n",
      "occurs. Parthenogenesis, we call it--that means virgin birth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not follow him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“BIRTH, we know, of course; but what is VIRGIN?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry looked uncomfortable, but Jeff met the question quite calmly.\n",
      "“Among mating animals, the term VIRGIN is applied to the female who has\n",
      "not mated,” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I see. And does it apply to the male also? Or is there a different\n",
      "term for him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed this over rather hurriedly, saying that the same term would\n",
      "apply, but was seldom used.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No?” she said. “But one cannot mate without the other surely. Is not\n",
      "each then--virgin--before mating? And, tell me, have you any forms of\n",
      "life in which there is birth from a father only?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know of none,” he answered, and I inquired seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ask us to believe that for two thousand years there have been only\n",
      "women here, and only girl babies born?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly,” answered Somel, nodding gravely. “Of course we know that\n",
      "among other animals it is not so, that there are fathers as well as\n",
      "mothers; and we see that you are fathers, that you come from a people\n",
      "who are of both kinds. We have been waiting, you see, for you to be able\n",
      "to speak freely with us, and teach us about your country and the rest of\n",
      "the world. You know so much, you see, and we know only our own land.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of our previous studies we had been at some pains to tell\n",
      "them about the big world outside, to draw sketches, maps, to make a\n",
      "globe, even, out of a spherical fruit, and show the size and relation of\n",
      "the countries, and to tell of the numbers of their people. All this had\n",
      "been scant and in outline, but they quite understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find I succeed very poorly in conveying the impression I would like to\n",
      "of these women. So far from being ignorant, they were deeply wise--that\n",
      "we realized more and more; and for clear reasoning, for real brain scope\n",
      "and power they were A No. 1, but there were a lot of things they did not\n",
      "know.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had the evenest tempers, the most perfect patience and good\n",
      "nature--one of the things most impressive about them all was the absence\n",
      "of irritability. So far we had only this group to study, but afterward I\n",
      "found it a common trait.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had gradually come to feel that we were in the hands of friends, and\n",
      "very capable ones at that--but we couldn’t form any opinion yet of the\n",
      "general level of these women.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We want you to teach us all you can,” Somel went on, her firm shapely\n",
      "hands clasped on the table before her, her clear quiet eyes meeting\n",
      "ours frankly. “And we want to teach you what we have that is novel and\n",
      "useful. You can well imagine that it is a wonderful event to us, to have\n",
      "men among us--after two thousand years. And we want to know about your\n",
      "women.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What she said about our importance gave instant pleasure to Terry. I\n",
      "could see by the way he lifted his head that it pleased him. But when\n",
      "she spoke of our women--someway I had a queer little indescribable\n",
      "feeling, not like any feeling I ever had before when “women” were\n",
      "mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you tell us how it came about?” Jeff pursued. “You said ‘for two\n",
      "thousand years’--did you have men here before that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” answered Zava.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all quiet for a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should have our full history to read--do not be alarmed--it has\n",
      "been made clear and short. It took us a long time to learn how to write\n",
      "history. Oh, how I should love to read yours!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned with flashing eager eyes, looking from one to the other of\n",
      "us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be so wonderful--would it not? To compare the history of two\n",
      "thousand years, to see what the differences are--between us, who are\n",
      "only mothers, and you, who are mothers and fathers, too. Of course we\n",
      "see, with our birds, that the father is as useful as the mother, almost.\n",
      "But among insects we find him of less importance, sometimes very little.\n",
      "Is it not so with you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes, birds and bugs,” Terry said, “but not among animals--have you\n",
      "NO animals?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have cats,” she said. “The father is not very useful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you no cattle--sheep--horses?” I drew some rough outlines of these\n",
      "beasts and showed them to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had, in the very old days, these,” said Somel, and sketched with\n",
      "swift sure touches a sort of sheep or llama, “and these”--dogs, of two\n",
      "or three kinds, “that that”--pointing to my absurd but recognizable\n",
      "horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What became of them?” asked Jeff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do not want them anymore. They took up too much room--we need all\n",
      "our land to feed our people. It is such a little country, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whatever do you do without milk?” Terry demanded incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“MILK? We have milk in abundance--our own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But--but--I mean for cooking--for grown people,” Terry blundered, while\n",
      "they looked amazed and a shade displeased.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff came to the rescue. “We keep cattle for their milk, as well as\n",
      "for their meat,” he explained. “Cow’s milk is a staple article of diet.\n",
      "There is a great milk industry--to collect and distribute it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still they looked puzzled. I pointed to my outline of a cow. “The farmer\n",
      "milks the cow,” I said, and sketched a milk pail, the stool, and in\n",
      "pantomime showed the man milking. “Then it is carried to the city and\n",
      "distributed by milkmen--everybody has it at the door in the morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Has the cow no child?” asked Somel earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes, of course, a calf, that is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there milk for the calf and you, too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It took some time to make clear to those three sweet-faced women the\n",
      "process which robs the cow of her calf, and the calf of its true food;\n",
      "and the talk led us into a further discussion of the meat business. They\n",
      "heard it out, looking very white, and presently begged to be excused.\n",

      "CHAPTER 5. A Unique History\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is no use for me to try to piece out this account with adventures.\n",
      "If the people who read it are not interested in these amazing women and\n",
      "their history, they will not be interested at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for us--three young men to a whole landful of women--what could we\n",
      "do? We did get away, as described, and were peacefully brought back\n",
      "again without, as Terry complained, even the satisfaction of hitting\n",
      "anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no adventures because there was nothing to fight. There were\n",
      "no wild beasts in the country and very few tame ones. Of these I might\n",
      "as well stop to describe the one common pet of the country. Cats, of\n",
      "course. But such cats!\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you suppose these Lady Burbanks had done with their cats? By the\n",
      "most prolonged and careful selection and exclusion they had developed a\n",
      "race of cats that did not sing! That’s a fact. The most those poor dumb\n",
      "brutes could do was to make a kind of squeak when they were hungry or\n",
      "wanted the door open, and, of course, to purr, and make the various\n",
      "mother-noises to their kittens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, they had ceased to kill birds. They were rigorously bred to\n",
      "destroy mice and moles and all such enemies of the food supply; but the\n",
      "birds were numerous and safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we were discussing birds, Terry asked them if they used feathers\n",
      "for their hats, and they seemed amused at the idea. He made a few\n",
      "sketches of our women’s hats, with plumes and quills and those various\n",
      "tickling things that stick out so far; and they were eagerly interested,\n",
      "as at everything about our women.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for them, they said they only wore hats for shade when working in the\n",
      "sun; and those were big light straw hats, something like those used in\n",
      "China and Japan. In cold weather they wore caps or hoods.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But for decorative purposes--don’t you think they would be becoming?”\n",
      " pursued Terry, making as pretty a picture as he could of a lady with a\n",
      "plumed hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "They by no means agreed to that, asking quite simply if the men wore the\n",
      "same kind. We hastened to assure her that they did not--drew for them\n",
      "our kind of headgear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And do no men wear feathers in their hats?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only Indians,” Jeff explained. “Savages, you know.” And he sketched a\n",
      "war bonnet to show them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And soldiers,” I added, drawing a military hat with plumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "They never expressed horror or disapproval, nor indeed much\n",
      "surprise--just a keen interest. And the notes they made!--miles of them!\n",
      "\n",
      "But to return to our pussycats. We were a good deal impressed by this\n",
      "achievement in breeding, and when they questioned us--I can tell you we\n",
      "were well pumped for information--we told of what had been done for dogs\n",
      "and horses and cattle, but that there was no effort applied to cats,\n",
      "except for show purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I could represent the kind, quiet, steady, ingenious way they\n",
      "questioned us. It was not just curiosity--they weren’t a bit more\n",
      "curious about us than we were about them, if as much. But they were\n",
      "bent on understanding our kind of civilization, and their lines of\n",
      "interrogation would gradually surround us and drive us in till we found\n",
      "ourselves up against some admissions we did not want to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are all these breeds of dogs you have made useful?” they asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--useful! Why, the hunting dogs and watchdogs and sheepdogs are\n",
      "useful--and sleddogs of course!--and ratters, I suppose, but we don’t\n",
      "keep dogs for their USEFULNESS. The dog is ‘the friend of man,’ we\n",
      "say--we love them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That they understood. “We love our cats that way. They surely are our\n",
      "friends, and helpers, too. You can see how intelligent and affectionate\n",
      "they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a fact. I’d never seen such cats, except in a few rare instances.\n",
      "Big, handsome silky things, friendly with everyone and devotedly\n",
      "attached to their special owners.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must have a heartbreaking time drowning kittens,” we suggested. But\n",
      "they said, “Oh, no! You see we care for them as you do for your valuable\n",
      "cattle. The fathers are few compared to the mothers, just a few very\n",
      "fine ones in each town; they live quite happily in walled gardens and\n",
      "the houses of their friends. But they only have a mating season once a\n",
      "year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rather hard on Thomas, isn’t it?” suggested Terry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, no--truly! You see, it is many centuries that we have been breeding\n",
      "the kind of cats we wanted. They are healthy and happy and friendly, as\n",
      "you see. How do you manage with your dogs? Do you keep them in pairs, or\n",
      "segregate the fathers, or what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we explained that--well, that it wasn’t a question of fathers\n",
      "exactly; that nobody wanted a--a mother dog; that, well, that\n",
      "practically all our dogs were males--there was only a very small\n",

      "\n",
      "Then Zava, observing Terry with her grave sweet smile, quoted back at\n",
      "him: “Rather hard on Thomas, isn’t it? Do they enjoy it--living without\n",
      "mates? Are your dogs as uniformly healthy and sweet-tempered as our\n",
      "cats?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff laughed, eyeing Terry mischievously. As a matter of fact we began\n",
      "to feel Jeff something of a traitor--he so often flopped over and took\n",
      "their side of things; also his medical knowledge gave him a different\n",
      "point of view somehow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sorry to admit,” he told them, “that the dog, with us, is the most\n",
      "diseased of any animal--next to man. And as to temper--there are always\n",
      "some dogs who bite people--especially children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was pure malice. You see, children were the--the RAISON D’ETRE in\n",
      "this country. All our interlocutors sat up straight at once. They were\n",
      "still gentle, still restrained, but there was a note of deep amazement\n",
      "in their voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do we understand that you keep an animal--an unmated male animal--that\n",
      "bites children? About how many are there of them, please?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thousands--in a large city,” said Jeff, “and nearly every family has\n",
      "one in the country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry broke in at this. “You must not imagine they are all\n",
      "dangerous--it’s not one in a hundred that ever bites anybody. Why, they\n",
      "are the best friends of the children--a boy doesn’t have half a chance\n",
      "that hasn’t a dog to play with!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the girls?” asked Somel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--girls--why they like them too,” he said, but his voice flatted a\n",
      "little. They always noticed little things like that, we found later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little by little they wrung from us the fact that the friend of man,\n",
      "in the city, was a prisoner; was taken out for his meager exercise on\n",
      "a leash; was liable not only to many diseases but to the one destroying\n",
      "horror of rabies; and, in many cases, for the safety of the citizens,\n",
      "had to go muzzled. Jeff maliciously added vivid instances he had known\n",
      "or read of injury and death from mad dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not scold or fuss about it. Calm as judges, those women were.\n",
      "But they made notes; Moadine read them to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please tell me if I have the facts correct,” she said. “In your\n",
      "country--and in others too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” we admitted, “in most civilized countries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In most civilized countries a kind of animal is kept which is no longer\n",
      "useful--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are a protection,” Terry insisted. “They bark if burglars try to\n",
      "get in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she made notes of “burglars” and went on: “because of the love\n",
      "which people bear to this animal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Zava interrupted here. “Is it the men or the women who love this animal\n",
      "so much?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Both!” insisted Terry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Equally?” she inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Jeff said, “Nonsense, Terry--you know men like dogs better than\n",
      "women do--as a whole.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because they love it so much--especially men. This animal is kept shut\n",
      "up, or chained.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” suddenly asked Somel. “We keep our father cats shut up because\n",
      "we do not want too much fathering; but they are not chained--they have\n",
      "large grounds to run in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A valuable dog would be stolen if he was let loose,” I said. “We put\n",
      "collars on them, with the owner’s name, in case they do stray. Besides,\n",
      "they get into fights--a valuable dog might easily be killed by a bigger\n",
      "one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see,” she said. “They fight when they meet--is that common?” We\n",
      "admitted that it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are kept shut up, or chained.” She paused again, and asked,\n",
      "“Is not a dog fond of running? Are they not built for speed?” That we\n",
      "admitted, too, and Jeff, still malicious, enlightened them further.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve always thought it was a pathetic sight, both ways--to see a man or\n",
      "a woman taking a dog to walk--at the end of a string.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you bred them to be as neat in their habits as cats are?” was the\n",
      "next question. And when Jeff told them of the effect of dogs on sidewalk\n",
      "merchandise and the streets generally, they found it hard to believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, their country was as neat as a Dutch kitchen, and as to\n",
      "sanitation--but I might as well start in now with as much as I\n",
      "can remember of the history of this amazing country before further\n",
      "description.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I’ll summarize here a bit as to our opportunities for learning it.\n",
      "I will not try to repeat the careful, detailed account I lost; I’ll just\n",
      "say that we were kept in that fortress a good six months all told, and\n",
      "after that, three in a pleasant enough city where--to Terry’s infinite\n",
      "disgust--there were only “Colonels” and little children--no young women\n",
      "whatever. Then we were under surveillance for three more--always with a\n",
      "tutor or a guard or both. But those months were pleasant because we were\n",
      "really getting acquainted with the girls. That was a chapter!--or will\n",
      "be--I will try to do justice to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We learned their language pretty thoroughly--had to; and they learned\n",
      "ours much more quickly and used it to hasten our own studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff, who was never without reading matter of some sort, had two little\n",
      "books with him, a novel and a little anthology of verse; and I had one\n",
      "of those pocket encyclopedias--a fat little thing, bursting with facts.\n",
      "These were used in our education--and theirs. Then as soon as we were up\n",
      "to it, they furnished us with plenty of their own books, and I went in\n",
      "for the history part--I wanted to understand the genesis of this miracle\n",
      "of theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is what happened, according to their records.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to geography--at about the time of the Christian era this land had\n",
      "a free passage to the sea. I’m not saying where, for good reasons. But\n",
      "there was a fairly easy pass through that wall of mountains behind us,\n",
      "and there is no doubt in my mind that these people were of Aryan stock,\n",
      "and were once in contact with the best civilization of the old world.\n",
      "They were “white,” but somewhat darker than our northern races because\n",
      "of their constant exposure to sun and air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The country was far larger then, including much land beyond the pass,\n",
      "and a strip of coast. They had ships, commerce, an army, a king--for at\n",
      "that time they were what they so calmly called us--a bi-sexual race.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happened to them first was merely a succession of historic\n",
      "misfortunes such as have befallen other nations often enough. They\n",
      "were decimated by war, driven up from their coastline till finally the\n",
      "reduced population, with many of the men killed in battle, occupied this\n",
      "hinterland, and defended it for years, in the mountain passes. Where it\n",
      "was open to any possible attack from below they strengthened the natural\n",
      "defenses so that it became unscalably secure, as we found it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were a polygamous people, and a slave-holding people, like all of\n",
      "their time; and during the generation or two of this struggle to defend\n",
      "their mountain home they built the fortresses, such as the one we were\n",
      "held in, and other of their oldest buildings, some still in use. Nothing\n",
      "but earthquakes could destroy such architecture--huge solid blocks,\n",
      "holding by their own weight. They must have had efficient workmen and\n",
      "enough of them in those days.\n",
      "\n",
      "They made a brave fight for their existence, but no nation can stand\n",
      "up against what the steamship companies call “an act of God.” While\n",
      "the whole fighting force was doing its best to defend their mountain\n",
      "pathway, there occurred a volcanic outburst, with some local tremors,\n",
      "and the result was the complete filling up of the pass--their only\n",
      "outlet. Instead of a passage, a new ridge, sheer and high, stood between\n",
      "them and the sea; they were walled in, and beneath that wall lay their\n",
      "whole little army. Very few men were left alive, save the slaves;\n",
      "and these now seized their opportunity, rose in revolt, killed their\n",
      "remaining masters even to the youngest boy, killed the old women too,\n",
      "and the mothers, intending to take possession of the country with the\n",
      "remaining young women and girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this succession of misfortunes was too much for those infuriated\n",
      "virgins. There were many of them, and but few of these would-be masters,\n",
      "so the young women, instead of submitting, rose in sheer desperation and\n",
      "slew their brutal conquerors.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sounds like Titus Andronicus, I know, but that is their account. I\n",
      "suppose they were about crazy--can you blame them?\n",
      "\n",
      "There was literally no one left on this beautiful high garden land but a\n",
      "bunch of hysterical girls and some older slave women.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was about two thousand years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first there was a period of sheer despair. The mountains towered\n",
      "between them and their old enemies, but also between them and escape.\n",
      "There was no way up or down or out--they simply had to stay there. Some\n",
      "were for suicide, but not the majority. They must have been a plucky\n",
      "lot, as a whole, and they decided to live--as long as they did live.\n",
      "Of course they had hope, as youth must, that something would happen to\n",
      "change their fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they set to work, to bury the dead, to plow and sow, to care for one\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of burying the dead, I will set down while I think of it, that\n",
      "they had adopted cremation in about the thirteenth century, for the same\n",
      "reason that they had left off raising cattle--they could not spare\n",
      "the room. They were much surprised to learn that we were still\n",
      "burying--asked our reasons for it, and were much dissatisfied with what\n",
      "we gave. We told them of the belief in the resurrection of the body, and\n",
      "they asked if our God was not as well able to resurrect from ashes as\n",
      "from long corruption. We told them of how people thought it repugnant to\n",
      "have their loved ones burn, and they asked if it was less repugnant to\n",
      "have them decay. They were inconveniently reasonable, those women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well--that original bunch of girls set to work to clean up the place and\n",
      "make their living as best they could. Some of the remaining slave women\n",
      "rendered invaluable service, teaching such trades as they knew. They\n",
      "had such records as were then kept, all the tools and implements of the\n",
      "time, and a most fertile land to work in.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were a handful of the younger matrons who had escaped slaughter,\n",
      "and a few babies were born after the cataclysm--but only two boys, and\n",
      "they both died.\n",
      "\n",
      "For five or ten years they worked together, growing stronger and wiser\n",
      "and more and more mutually attached, and then the miracle happened--one\n",
      "of these young women bore a child. Of course they all thought there must\n",
      "be a man somewhere, but none was found. Then they decided it must be a\n",
      "direct gift from the gods, and placed the proud mother in the Temple of\n",
      "Maaia--their Goddess of Motherhood--under strict watch. And there,\n",
      "as years passed, this wonder-woman bore child after child, five of\n",
      "them--all girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did my best, keenly interested as I have always been in sociology and\n",
      "social psychology, to reconstruct in my mind the real position of these\n",
      "ancient women. There were some five or six hundred of them, and they\n",
      "were harem-bred; yet for the few preceding generations they had been\n",
      "reared in the atmosphere of such heroic struggle that the stock must\n",
      "have been toughened somewhat. Left alone in that terrific orphanhood,\n",
      "they had clung together, supporting one another and their little\n",
      "sisters, and developing unknown powers in the stress of new necessity.\n",
      "To this pain-hardened and work-strengthened group, who had lost not only\n",
      "the love and care of parents, but the hope of ever having children of\n",
      "their own, there now dawned the new hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here at last was Motherhood, and though it was not for all of them\n",
      "personally, it might--if the power was inherited--found here a new race.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be imagined how those five Daughters of Maaia, Children of the\n",
      "Temple, Mothers of the Future--they had all the titles that love and\n",
      "hope and reverence could give--were reared. The whole little nation\n",
      "of women surrounded them with loving service, and waited, between a\n",
      "boundless hope and an equally boundless despair, to see if they, too,\n",
      "would be mothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they were! As fast as they reached the age of twenty-five they began\n",
      "bearing. Each of them, like her mother, bore five daughters. Presently\n",
      "there were twenty-five New Women, Mothers in their own right, and the\n",
      "whole spirit of the country changed from mourning and mere courageous\n",
      "resignation to proud joy. The older women, those who remembered men,\n",
      "died off; the youngest of all the first lot of course died too, after\n",
      "a while, and by that time there were left one hundred and fifty-five\n",
      "parthenogenetic women, founding a new race.\n",
      "\n",
      "They inherited all that the devoted care of that declining band of\n",
      "original ones could leave them. Their little country was quite safe.\n",
      "Their farms and gardens were all in full production. Such industries\n",
      "as they had were in careful order. The records of their past were all\n",
      "preserved, and for years the older women had spent their time in the\n",
      "best teaching they were capable of, that they might leave to the little\n",
      "group of sisters and mothers all they possessed of skill and knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "There you have the start of Herland! One family, all descended from one\n",
      "mother! She lived to a hundred years old; lived to see her hundred and\n",
      "twenty-five great-granddaughters born; lived as Queen-Priestess-Mother\n",
      "of them all; and died with a nobler pride and a fuller joy than perhaps\n",
      "any human soul has ever known--she alone had founded a new race!\n",
      "\n",
      "The first five daughters had grown up in an atmosphere of holy calm,\n",
      "of awed watchful waiting, of breathless prayer. To them the longed-for\n",
      "motherhood was not only a personal joy, but a nation’s hope. Their\n",
      "twenty-five daughters in turn, with a stronger hope, a richer, wider\n",
      "outlook, with the devoted love and care of all the surviving population,\n",
      "grew up as a holy sisterhood, their whole ardent youth looking\n",
      "forward to their great office. And at last they were left alone; the\n",
      "white-haired First Mother was gone, and this one family, five sisters,\n",
      "twenty-five first cousins, and a hundred and twenty-five second cousins,\n",
      "began a new race.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here you have human beings, unquestionably, but what we were slow in\n",
      "understanding was how these ultra-women, inheriting only from women, had\n",
      "eliminated not only certain masculine characteristics, which of\n",
      "course we did not look for, but so much of what we had always thought\n",
      "essentially feminine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tradition of men as guardians and protectors had quite died out.\n",
      "These stalwart virgins had no men to fear and therefore no need of\n",
      "protection. As to wild beasts--there were none in their sheltered land.\n",
      "\n",
      "The power of mother-love, that maternal instinct we so highly laud, was\n",
      "theirs of course, raised to its highest power; and a sister-love which,\n",
      "even while recognizing the actual relationship, we found it hard to\n",
      "credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry, incredulous, even contemptuous, when we were alone, refused to\n",
      "believe the story. “A lot of traditions as old as Herodotus--and\n",
      "about as trustworthy!” he said. “It’s likely women--just a pack of\n",
      "women--would have hung together like that! We all know women can’t\n",
      "organize--that they scrap like anything--are frightfully jealous.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But these New Ladies didn’t have anyone to be jealous of, remember,”\n",
      " drawled Jeff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s a likely story,” Terry sneered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t you invent a likelier one?” I asked him. “Here ARE the\n",
      "women--nothing but women, and you yourself admit there’s no trace of a\n",
      "man in the country.” This was after we had been about a good deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll admit that,” he growled. “And it’s a big miss, too. There’s not\n",
      "only no fun without ‘em--no real sport--no competition; but these women\n",
      "aren’t WOMANLY. You know they aren’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That kind of talk always set Jeff going; and I gradually grew to side\n",
      "with him. “Then you don’t call a breed of women whose one concern is\n",
      "motherhood--womanly?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed I don’t,” snapped Terry. “What does a man care for\n",
      "motherhood--when he hasn’t a ghost of a chance at fatherhood? And\n",
      "besides--what’s the good of talking sentiment when we are just men\n",
      "together? What a man wants of women is a good deal more than all this\n",
      "‘motherhood’!”\n",
      "\n",
      "We were as patient as possible with Terry. He had lived about nine\n",
      "months among the “Colonels” when he made that outburst; and with\n",
      "no chance at any more strenuous excitement than our gymnastics gave\n",
      "us--save for our escape fiasco. I don’t suppose Terry had ever lived so\n",
      "long with neither Love, Combat, nor Danger to employ his superabundant\n",
      "energies, and he was irritable. Neither Jeff nor I found it so wearing.\n",
      "I was so much interested intellectually that our confinement did not\n",
      "wear on me; and as for Jeff, bless his heart!--he enjoyed the society of\n",
      "that tutor of his almost as much as if she had been a girl--I don’t know\n",
      "but more.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to Terry’s criticism, it was true. These women, whose essential\n",
      "distinction of motherhood was the dominant note of their whole culture,\n",
      "were strikingly deficient in what we call “femininity.” This led me very\n",
      "promptly to the conviction that those “feminine charms” we are so fond\n",
      "of are not feminine at all, but mere reflected masculinity--developed to\n",
      "please us because they had to please us, and in no way essential to\n",
      "the real fulfillment of their great process. But Terry came to no such\n",
      "conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just you wait till I get out!” he muttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we both cautioned him. “Look here, Terry, my boy! You be careful!\n",
      "They’ve been mighty good to us--but do you remember the anesthesia? If\n",
      "you do any mischief in this virgin land, beware of the vengeance of the\n",

      "\n",
      "To return to the history:\n",
      "\n",
      "They began at once to plan and built for their children, all the\n",
      "strength and intelligence of the whole of them devoted to that one\n",
      "thing. Each girl, of course, was reared in full knowledge of her\n",
      "Crowning Office, and they had, even then, very high ideas of the molding\n",
      "powers of the mother, as well as those of education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such high ideals as they had! Beauty, Health, Strength, Intellect,\n",
      "Goodness--for those they prayed and worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had no enemies; they themselves were all sisters and friends. The\n",
      "land was fair before them, and a great future began to form itself in\n",
      "their minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The religion they had to begin with was much like that of old Greece--a\n",
      "number of gods and goddesses; but they lost all interest in deities\n",
      "of war and plunder, and gradually centered on their Mother Goddess\n",
      "altogether. Then, as they grew more intelligent, this had turned into a\n",
      "sort of Maternal Pantheism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was Mother Earth, bearing fruit. All that they ate was fruit of\n",
      "motherhood, from seed or egg or their product. By motherhood they were\n",
      "born and by motherhood they lived--life was, to them, just the long\n",
      "cycle of motherhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "But very early they recognized the need of improvement as well as\n",
      "of mere repetition, and devoted their combined intelligence to that\n",
      "problem--how to make the best kind of people. First this was merely the\n",
      "hope of bearing better ones, and then they recognized that however\n",
      "the children differed at birth, the real growth lay later--through\n",
      "education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then things began to hum.\n",

      "As I learned more and more to appreciate what these women had\n",

      "\n",
      "You see, they had had no wars. They had had no kings, and no priests,\n",
      "and no aristocracies. They were sisters, and as they grew, they grew\n",
      "together--not by competition, but by united action.\n",
      "\n",
      "We tried to put in a good word for competition, and they were keenly\n",
      "interested. Indeed, we soon found from their earnest questions of us\n",
      "that they were prepared to believe our world must be better than theirs.\n",
      "They were not sure; they wanted to know; but there was no such arrogance\n",
      "about them as might have been expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "We rather spread ourselves, telling of the advantages of competition:\n",
      "how it developed fine qualities; that without it there would be “no\n",
      "stimulus to industry.” Terry was very strong on that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No stimulus to industry,” they repeated, with that puzzled look we had\n",
      "learned to know so well. “STIMULUS? TO INDUSTRY? But don’t you LIKE to\n",
      "work?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No man would work unless he had to,” Terry declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, no MAN! You mean that is one of your sex distinctions?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed!” he said hastily. “No one, I mean, man or woman, would work\n",
      "without incentive. Competition is the--the motor power, you see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not with us,” they explained gently, “so it is hard for us to\n",
      "understand. Do you mean, for instance, that with you no mother would\n",
      "work for her children without the stimulus of competition?”\n",
      "\n",
      "No, he admitted that he did not mean that. Mothers, he supposed, would\n",
      "of course work for their children in the home; but the world’s work\n",
      "was different--that had to be done by men, and required the competitive\n",
      "element.\n",
      "\n",
      "All our teachers were eagerly interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We want so much to know--you have the whole world to tell us of, and we\n",

      "us--what is the work of the world, that men do--which we have not here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, everything,” Terry said grandly. “The men do everything, with us.”\n",
      " He squared his broad shoulders and lifted his chest. “We do not allow\n",
      "our women to work. Women are loved--idolized--honored--kept in the home\n",
      "to care for the children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is ‘the home’?” asked Somel a little wistfully.\n",

      "\n",
      "But just as a clear-eyed, intelligent, perfectly honest, and\n",
      "well-meaning child will frequently jar one’s self-esteem by innocent\n",
      "questions, so did these women, without the slightest appearance of\n",
      "malice or satire, continually bring up points of discussion which we\n",
      "spent our best efforts in evading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we were fairly proficient in their language, had read a lot\n",
      "about their history, and had given them the general outlines of ours,\n",
      "they were able to press their questions closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when Jeff admitted the number of “women wage earners” we had, they\n",
      "instantly asked for the total population, for the proportion of adult\n",

      "that the laws of nature require a struggle for existence, and that in\n",
      "the struggle the fittest survive, and the unfit perish. In our economic\n",
      "struggle, I continued, there was always plenty of opportunity for the\n",
      "fittest to reach the top, which they did, in great numbers, particularly\n",
      "in our country; that where there was severe economic pressure the lowest\n",
      "classes of course felt it the worst, and that among the poorest of all\n",
      "the women were driven into the labor market by necessity.\n",
      "\n",
      "They listened closely, with the usual note-taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About one-third, then, belong to the poorest class,” observed Moadine\n",

      "\n",
      "Jeff--he was getting as bad as they were--solemnly replied that, on the\n",
      "contrary, the poorer they were, the more children they had. That too, he\n",

      "to individuation.”\n",

      "finished politely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh no,” Moadine told him. “We have no laws over a hundred years old,\n",
      "and most of them are under twenty. In a few weeks more,” she continued,\n",
      "“we are going to have the pleasure of showing you over our little land\n",

      "of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to geography, they had the tradition of the Great Sea, beyond the\n",

      "ancient condition--not “before the flood” with them, but before that\n",
      "mighty quake which had cut them off so completely--they were aware that\n",
      "there were other peoples and other countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In geology they were quite ignorant.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to anthropology, they had those same remnants of information about\n",
      "other peoples, and the knowledge of the savagery of the occupants of\n",
      "those dim forests below. Nevertheless, they had inferred (marvelously\n",
      "keen on inference and deduction their minds were!) the existence and\n",

      "other planets.\n",

      "When our biplane came whirring over their heads in that first scouting\n",
      "flight of ours, they had instantly accepted it as proof of the high\n",

      "cautiously and eagerly as we might prepare to welcome visitors who came\n",
      "“by meteor” from Mars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of history--outside their own--they knew nothing, of course, save for\n",

      "science; and with it, a surprising range and facility in mathematics.\n",

      "Physiology they were quite familiar with. Indeed, when it came to the\n",
      "simpler and more concrete sciences, wherein the subject matter was at\n",
      "hand and they had but to exercise their minds upon it, the results were\n",
      "surprising. They had worked out a chemistry, a botany, a physics,\n",
      "with all the blends where a science touches an art, or merges into\n",
      "an industry, to such fullness of knowledge as made us feel like\n",
      "schoolchildren.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also we found this out--as soon as we were free of the country, and\n",
      "by further study and question--that what one knew, all knew, to a very\n",
      "considerable extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I talked later with little mountain girls from the fir-dark valleys\n",
      "away up at their highest part, and with sunburned plains-women and agile\n",
      "foresters, all over the country, as well as those in the towns, and\n",
      "everywhere there was the same high level of intelligence. Some knew far\n",
      "more than others about one thing--they were specialized, of course; but\n",
      "all of them knew more about everything--that is, about everything the\n",

      "they were far better educated than our people.\n",
      "\n",
      "With what we told them, from what sketches and models we were able to\n",

      "What they were doing with us was like--like--well, say like Napoleon\n",
      "extracting military information from a few illiterate peasants. They\n",
      "knew just what to ask, and just what use to make of it; they had\n",
      "mechanical appliances for disseminating information almost equal to ours\n",
      "at home; and by the time we were led forth to lecture, our audiences\n",
      "had thoroughly mastered a well-arranged digest of all we had previously\n",
      "given to our teachers, and were prepared with such notes and questions\n",
      "as might have intimidated a university professor.\n",
      "\n",

      "half-blustering air of his. At first he used to storm and flourish quite\n",
      "a good deal, but nothing seemed to amuse them more; they would gather\n",
      "around and watch him as if it was an exhibition, politely, but with\n",
      "evident interest. So he learned to check himself, and was almost\n",
      "reasonable in his bearing--but not quite.\n",

      "She announced smoothly and evenly: “Not in the least. I thought it was\n",

      "\n",

      "understand more fully than we did. And he tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can see it now, or at least much more of it, but it has taken me a\n",
      "long time, and a good deal of honest intellectual effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "What they call Motherhood was like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "They began with a really high degree of social development, something\n",
      "like that of Ancient Egypt or Greece. Then they suffered the loss of\n",
      "everything masculine, and supposed at first that all human power and\n",
      "safety had gone too. Then they developed this virgin birth capacity.\n",
      "Then, since the prosperity of their children depended on it, the fullest\n",
      "and subtlest coordination began to be practiced.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember how long Terry balked at the evident unanimity of these\n",
      "women--the most conspicuous feature of their whole culture. “It’s\n",
      "impossible!” he would insist. “Women cannot cooperate--it’s against\n",
      "nature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When we urged the obvious facts he would say: “Fiddlesticks!” or “Hang\n",
      "your facts--I tell you it can’t be done!” And we never succeeded in\n",
      "shutting him up till Jeff dragged in the hymenoptera.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Go to the ant, thou sluggard’--and learn something,” he said\n",
      "triumphantly. “Don’t they cooperate pretty well? You can’t beat it. This\n",
      "place is just like an enormous anthill--you know an anthill is nothing\n",
      "but a nursery. And how about bees? Don’t they manage to cooperate and\n",
      "love one another? as that precious Constable had it. Just show me a\n",
      "combination of male creatures, bird, bug, or beast, that works as well,\n",
      "will you? Or one of our masculine countries where the people work\n",
      "together as well as they do here! I tell you, women are the natural\n",
      "cooperators, not men!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry had to learn a good many things he did not want to. To go back to\n",
      "my little analysis of what happened:\n",
      "\n",
      "They developed all this close inter-service in the interests of their\n",
      "children. To do the best work they had to specialize, of course; the\n",
      "children needed spinners and weavers, farmers and gardeners, carpenters\n",
      "and masons, as well as mothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the filling up of the place. When a population multiplies\n",
      "by five every thirty years it soon reaches the limits of a country,\n",
      "especially a small one like this. They very soon eliminated all the\n",
      "grazing cattle--sheep were the last to go, I believe. Also, they worked\n",
      "out a system of intensive agriculture surpassing anything I ever heard\n",
      "of, with the very forests all reset with fruit- or nut-bearing trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do what they would, however, there soon came a time when they were\n",
      "confronted with the problem of “the pressure of population” in an acute\n",
      "form. There was really crowding, and with it, unavoidably, a decline in\n",
      "standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how did those women meet it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not by a “struggle for existence” which would result in an everlasting\n",
      "writhing mass of underbred people trying to get ahead of one\n",
      "another--some few on top, temporarily, many constantly crushed out\n",
      "underneath, a hopeless substratum of paupers and degenerates, and no\n",
      "serenity or peace for anyone, no possibility for really noble qualities\n",
      "among the people at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither did they start off on predatory excursions to get more land from\n",
      "somebody else, or to get more food from somebody else, to maintain their\n",
      "struggling mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not at all. They sat down in council together and thought it out. Very\n",
      "clear, strong thinkers they were. They said: “With our best endeavors\n",
      "this country will support about so many people, with the standard of\n",
      "peace, comfort, health, beauty, and progress we demand. Very well. That\n",
      "is all the people we will make.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There you have it. You see, they were Mothers, not in our sense of\n",
      "helpless involuntary fecundity, forced to fill and overfill the land,\n",
      "every land, and then see their children suffer, sin, and die, fighting\n",
      "horribly with one another; but in the sense of Conscious Makers\n",
      "of People. Mother-love with them was not a brute passion, a mere\n",
      "“instinct,” a wholly personal feeling; it was--a religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It included that limitless feeling of sisterhood, that wide unity in\n",

      "Racial, Human--oh, I don’t know how to say it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are used to seeing what we call “a mother” completely wrapped up in\n",

      "so far as we knew there had been no attempt at comparison, each people\n",
      "pursuing its own custom in the fond conviction of superiority, and\n",
      "either despising or quite ignoring the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these women the most salient quality in all their institutions was\n",
      "reasonableness. When I dug into the records to follow out any line of\n",
      "development, that was the most astonishing thing--the conscious effort\n",
      "to make it better.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had early observed the value of certain improvements, had easily\n",
      "inferred that there was room for more, and took the greatest pains to\n",
      "develop two kinds of minds--the critic and inventor. Those who showed\n",
      "an early tendency to observe, to discriminate, to suggest, were given\n",
      "special training for that function; and some of their highest officials\n",
      "spent their time in the most careful study of one or another branch of\n",
      "work, with a view to its further improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In each generation there was sure to arrive some new mind to detect\n",
      "faults and show need of alterations; and the whole corps of inventors\n",
      "was at hand to apply their special faculty at the point criticized, and\n",
      "offer suggestions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had learned by this time not to open a discussion on any of their\n",
      "characteristics without first priming ourselves to answer questions\n",
      "about our own methods; so I kept rather quiet on this matter of\n",
      "conscious improvement. We were not prepared to show our way was better.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was growing in our minds, at least in Jeff’s and mine, a\n",
      "keen appreciation of the advantages of this strange country and its\n",
      "management. Terry remained critical. We laid most of it to his nerves.\n",
      "He certainly was irritable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most conspicuous feature of the whole land was the perfection of\n",
      "its food supply. We had begun to notice from that very first walk in the\n",
      "forest, the first partial view from our ‘plane. Now we were taken to see\n",
      "this mighty garden, and shown its methods of culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "The country was about the size of Holland, some ten or twelve\n",
      "thousand square miles. One could lose a good many Hollands along the\n",
      "forest-smothered flanks of those mighty mountains. They had a population\n",
      "of about three million--not a large one, but quality is something. Three\n",
      "million is quite enough to allow for considerable variation, and these\n",
      "people varied more widely than we could at first account for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry had insisted that if they were parthenogenetic they’d be as alike\n",
      "as so many ants or aphids; he urged their visible differences as proof\n",
      "that there must be men--somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when we asked them, in our later, more intimate conversations, how\n",
      "they accounted for so much divergence without cross-fertilization,\n",
      "they attributed it partly to the careful education, which followed each\n",
      "slight tendency to differ, and partly to the law of mutation. This they\n",
      "had found in their work with plants, and fully proven in their own case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Physically they were more alike than we, as they lacked all morbid or\n",
      "excessive types. They were tall, strong, healthy, and beautiful as a\n",
      "race, but differed individually in a wide range of feature, coloring,\n",
      "and expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But surely the most important growth is in mind--and in the things we\n",
      "make,” urged Somel. “Do you find your physical variation accompanied by\n",
      "a proportionate variation in ideas, feelings, and products? Or, among\n",
      "people who look more alike, do you find their internal life and their\n",
      "work as similar?”\n",
      "\n",
      "We were rather doubtful on this point, and inclined to hold that there\n",
      "was more chance of improvement in greater physical variation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It certainly should be,” Zava admitted. “We have always thought it a\n",
      "grave initial misfortune to have lost half our little world. Perhaps\n",
      "that is one reason why we have so striven for conscious improvement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But acquired traits are not transmissible,” Terry declared. “Weissman\n",
      "has proved that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They never disputed our absolute statements, only made notes of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that is so, then our improvement must be due either to mutation, or\n",
      "solely to education,” she gravely pursued. “We certainly have improved.\n",
      "It may be that all these higher qualities were latent in the original\n",
      "mother, that careful education is bringing them out, and that our\n",
      "personal differences depend on slight variations in prenatal condition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it is more in your accumulated culture,” Jeff suggested. “And\n",
      "in the amazing psychic growth you have made. We know very little about\n",
      "methods of real soul culture--and you seem to know a great deal.”\n",
      "\n",

      "and were equally pleasant to live with, at least when they wore their\n",

      "chosen few. Later we were more and more impressed that all this gentle\n",

      "As for the intelligence, I confess that this was the most impressive\n",
      "and, to me, most mortifying, of any single feature of Herland. We soon\n",

      "obvious commonplaces as to call forth embarrassing questions about our\n",

      "Having improved their agriculture to the highest point, and carefully\n",
      "estimated the number of persons who could comfortably live on their\n",
      "square miles; having then limited their population to that number, one\n",
      "would think that was all there was to be done. But they had not thought\n",
      "so. To them the country was a unit--it was theirs. They themselves were\n",
      "a unit, a conscious group; they thought in terms of the community. As\n",
      "such, their time-sense was not limited to the hopes and ambitions of an\n",

      "I had never seen, had scarcely imagined, human beings undertaking such\n",
      "a work as the deliberate replanting of an entire forest area with\n",
      "different kinds of trees. Yet this seemed to them the simplest common\n",
      "sense, like a man’s plowing up an inferior lawn and reseeding it. Now\n",
      "every tree bore fruit--edible fruit, that is. In the case of one\n",
      "tree, in which they took especial pride, it had originally no fruit at\n",
      "all--that is, none humanly edible--yet was so beautiful that they wished\n",
      "to keep it. For nine hundred years they had experimented, and now\n",
      "showed us this particularly lovely graceful tree, with a profuse crop of\n",
      "nutritious seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had early decided that trees were the best food plants, requiring\n",
      "far less labor in tilling the soil, and bearing a larger amount of food\n",
      "for the same ground space; also doing much to preserve and enrich the\n",
      "soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due regard had been paid to seasonable crops, and their fruit and nuts,\n",
      "grains and berries, kept on almost the year through.\n",

      "On the higher part of the country, near the backing wall of mountains,\n",
      "they had a real winter with snow. Toward the south-eastern point, where\n",
      "there was a large valley with a lake whose outlet was subterranean, the\n",
      "climate was like that of California, and citrus fruits, figs, and olives\n",
      "grew abundantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "What impressed me particularly was their scheme of fertilization. Here\n",
      "was this little shut-in piece of land where one would have thought an\n",
      "ordinary people would have been starved out long ago or reduced to an\n",
      "annual struggle for life. These careful culturists had worked out a\n",
      "perfect scheme of refeeding the soil with all that came out of it. All\n",
      "the scraps and leavings of their food, plant waste from lumber work or\n",
      "textile industry, all the solid matter from the sewage, properly treated\n",
      "and combined--everything which came from the earth went back to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The practical result was like that in any healthy forest; an\n",

      "diverting them, by referring to the extent of our own land, and\n",
      "the--admitted--carelessness with which we had skimmed the cream of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least we thought we had diverted them. Later I found that besides\n",

      "sort of skeleton chart, on which the things we said and the things we\n",
      "palpably avoided saying were all set down and studied. It really was\n",
      "child’s play for those profound educators to work out a painfully\n",
      "accurate estimate of our conditions--in some lines. When a given line of\n",
      "observation seemed to lead to some very dreadful inference they always\n",
      "gave us the benefit of the doubt, leaving it open to further knowledge.\n",
      "Some of the things we had grown to accept as perfectly natural, or\n",
      "as belonging to our human limitations, they literally could not have\n",

      "impossible to explain--we tried it.\n",

      "open country, quietly rich and lovely; on the other, the garden, with\n",
      "tables here and there, far apart enough for privacy. Let me say right\n",

      "our highest art, only allowed to our highest artists.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Education?” I was puzzled again. “I don’t mean education. I mean by\n",

      "among these many virtues.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not usually,” she patiently explained. “You see, almost every woman\n",
      "values her maternity above everything else. Each girl holds it close\n",
      "and dear, an exquisite joy, a crowning honor, the most intimate, most\n",
      "personal, most precious thing. That is, the child-rearing has come to\n",
      "be with us a culture so profoundly studied, practiced with such subtlety\n",

      "teeth? Or to wish to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why no--of course not,” I protested. “But that is a highly specialized\n",
      "craft. Surely the care of babies is open to any woman--any mother!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do not think so,” she gently replied. “Those of us who are the\n",

      "“But the poor mother--bereaved of her baby--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh no!” she earnestly assured me. “Not in the least bereaved. It is her\n",
      "baby still--it is with her--she has not lost it. But she is not the only\n",
      "one to care for it. There are others whom she knows to be wiser. She\n",
      "knows it because she has studied as they did, practiced as they did, and\n",
      "honors their real superiority. For the child’s sake, she is glad to have\n",
      "for it this highest care.”\n",

      "\n",
      "I remember the first time--and how careful we were about our clothes,\n",

      "about the cut of his beard, and so critical of our combined efforts,\n",
      "that we handed him the shears and told him to please himself. We\n",
      "began to rather prize those beards of ours; they were almost our sole\n",
      "distinction among those tall and sturdy women, with their cropped hair\n",
      "and sexless costume. Being offered a wide selection of garments, we had\n",

      "He was a very impressive figure, his strong features softened by the\n",

      "“We are so utterly ignorant, you see,” Moadine had explained to us. “We\n",

      "just the brain work of one small half-country; and you, we gather, have\n",

      "\n",
      "We were eager to see it, and deeply impressed. To us, at first, these\n",
      "women, unavoidably ignorant of what to us was the basic commonplace of\n",
      "knowledge, had seemed on the plane of children, or of savages. What we\n",
      "had been forced to admit, with growing acquaintance, was that they\n",
      "were ignorant as Plato and Aristotle were, but with a highly developed\n",
      "mentality quite comparable to that of Ancient Greece.\n",

      "Far be it from me to lumber these pages with an account of what we so\n",
      "imperfectly strove to teach them. The memorable fact is what they taught\n",

      "\n",
      "Girls--hundreds of them--eager, bright-eyed, attentive young faces;\n",
      "crowding questions, and, I regret to say, an increasing inability on our\n",

      "\n",
      "Our special guides, who were on the platform with us, and sometimes\n",

      "later.\n",

      "somewhat as a glad swimmer takes to the sea. Jeff, with a rapt look on\n",
      "his high-bred face, approached as to a sacrament. But I was a little\n",
      "chilled by that last thought of mine, and kept my eyes open. I found\n",
      "time to watch Jeff, even while I was surrounded by an eager group of\n",
      "questioners--as we all were--and saw how his worshipping eyes, his grave\n",
      "courtesy, pleased and drew some of them; while others, rather stronger\n",
      "spirits they looked to be, drew away from his group to Terry’s or mine.\n",

      "see, just in snatches, of course, how his suave and masterful approach\n",
      "seemed to irritate them; his too-intimate glances were vaguely resented,\n",
      "his compliments puzzled and annoyed. Sometimes a girl would flush, not\n",
      "with drooped eyelids and inviting timidity, but with anger and a quick\n",
      "lift of the head. Girl after girl turned on her heel and left him, till\n",

      "least “girlish” of the lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw him looking pleased at first, as if he thought he was making\n",
      "a strong impression; but, finally, casting a look at Jeff, or me, he\n",
      "seemed less pleased--and less.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for me, I was most agreeably surprised. At home I never\n",
      "was “popular.” I had my girl friends, good ones, but they were\n",
      "friends--nothing else. Also they were of somewhat the same clan, not\n",
      "popular in the sense of swarming admirers. But here, to my astonishment,\n",
      "I found my crowd was the largest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to generalize, of course, rather telescoping many impressions;\n",
      "but the first evening was a good sample of the impression we made. Jeff\n",
      "had a following, if I may call it that, of the more sentimental--though\n",
      "that’s not the word I want. The less practical, perhaps; the girls who\n",
      "were artists of some sort, ethicists, teachers--that kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry was reduced to a rather combative group: keen, logical, inquiring\n",
      "minds, not overly sensitive, the very kind he liked least; while, as for\n",
      "me--I became quite cocky over my general popularity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry was furious about it. We could hardly blame him.\n",
      "\n",

      "He was angry and severe, not a little jealous, too, I think. Afterward,\n",
      "when he found out just what it was they did not like, he changed his\n",
      "manner somewhat and got on better. He had to. For, in spite of his\n",
      "criticism, they were girls, and, furthermore, all the girls there\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What I’m trying to show here is that with these women the whole\n",
      "relationship of life counted in a glad, eager growing-up to join the\n",
      "ranks of workers in the line best loved; a deep, tender reverence for\n",
      "one’s own mother--too deep for them to speak of freely--and beyond that,\n",
      "the whole, free, wide range of sisterhood, the splendid service of the\n",
      "country, and friendships.\n",
      "\n",
      "To these women we came, filled with the ideas, convictions, traditions,\n",
      "of our culture, and undertook to rouse in them the emotions which--to\n",
      "us--seemed proper.\n",
      "\n",
      "However much, or little, of true sex-feeling there was between us, it\n",
      "phrased itself in their minds in terms of friendship, the one purely\n",
      "personal love they knew, and of ultimate parentage. Visibly we were not\n",
      "mothers, nor children, nor compatriots; so, if they loved us, we must be\n",
      "friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "That we should pair off together in our courting days was natural to\n",
      "them; that we three should remain much together, as they did themselves,\n",
      "was also natural. We had as yet no work, so we hung about them in their\n",
      "forest tasks; that was natural, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when we began to talk about each couple having “homes” of our own,\n",
      "they could not understand it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our work takes us all around the country,” explained Celis. “We cannot\n",
      "live in one place all the time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are together now,” urged Alima, looking proudly at Terry’s stalwart\n",
      "nearness. (This was one of the times when they were “on,” though\n",
      "presently “off” again.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not the same thing at all,” he insisted. “A man wants a home of\n",
      "his own, with his wife and family in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Staying in it? All the time?” asked Ellador. “Not imprisoned, surely!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course not! Living there--naturally,” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What does she do there--all the time?” Alima demanded. “What is her\n",
      "work?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Terry patiently explained again that our women did not work--with\n",
      "reservations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what do they do--if they have no work?” she persisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They take care of the home--and the children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the same time?” asked Ellador.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why yes. The children play about, and the mother has charge of it all.\n",
      "There are servants, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed so obvious, so natural to Terry, that he always grew\n",
      "impatient; but the girls were honestly anxious to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How many children do your women have?” Alima had her notebook out now,\n",
      "and a rather firm set of lip. Terry began to dodge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no set number, my dear,” he explained. “Some have more, some\n",
      "have less.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some have none at all,” I put in mischievously.\n",
      "\n",
      "They pounced on this admission and soon wrung from us the general fact\n",
      "that those women who had the most children had the least servants, and\n",
      "those who had the most servants had the least children.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There!” triumphed Alima. “One or two or no children, and three or four\n",
      "servants. Now what do those women DO?”\n",
      "\n",
      "We explained as best we might. We talked of “social duties,”\n",
      " disingenuously banking on their not interpreting the words as we did; we\n",
      "talked of hospitality, entertainment, and various “interests.” All the\n",
      "time we knew that to these large-minded women whose whole mental outlook\n",
      "was so collective, the limitations of a wholly personal life were\n",
      "inconceivable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We cannot really understand it,” Ellador concluded. “We are only half\n",
      "a people. We have our woman-ways and they have their man-ways and their\n",
      "both-ways. We have worked out a system of living which is, of course,\n",
      "limited. They must have a broader, richer, better one. I should like to\n",
      "see it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall, dearest,” I whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s nothing to smoke,” complained Terry. He was in the midst of a\n",
      "prolonged quarrel with Alima, and needed a sedative. “There’s nothing to\n",
      "drink. These blessed women have no pleasant vices. I wish we could get\n",
      "out of here!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This wish was vain. We were always under a certain degree of\n",
      "watchfulness. When Terry burst forth to tramp the streets at night he\n",
      "always found a “Colonel” here or there; and when, on an occasion of\n",
      "fierce though temporary despair, he had plunged to the cliff edge with\n",
      "some vague view to escape, he found several of them close by. We were\n",
      "free--but there was a string to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They’ve no unpleasant ones, either,” Jeff reminded him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wish they had!” Terry persisted. “They’ve neither the vices of men, nor\n",
      "the virtues of women--they’re neuters!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know better than that. Don’t talk nonsense,” said I, severely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was thinking of Ellador’s eyes when they gave me a certain look, a\n",
      "look she did not at all realize.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff was equally incensed. “I don’t know what ‘virtues of women’ you\n",
      "miss. Seems to me they have all of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They’ve no modesty,” snapped Terry. “No patience, no submissiveness,\n",
      "none of that natural yielding which is woman’s greatest charm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I shook my head pityingly. “Go and apologize and make friends again,\n",
      "Terry. You’ve got a grouch, that’s all. These women have the virtue\n",
      "of humanity, with less of its faults than any folks I ever saw. As for\n",
      "patience--they’d have pitched us over the cliffs the first day we lit\n",
      "among ‘em, if they hadn’t that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are no--distractions,” he grumbled. “Nowhere a man can go and cut\n",
      "loose a bit. It’s an everlasting parlor and nursery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And workshop,” I added. “And school, and office, and laboratory, and\n",
      "studio, and theater, and--home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“HOME!” he sneered. “There isn’t a home in the whole pitiful place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There isn’t anything else, and you know it,” Jeff retorted hotly. “I\n",
      "never saw, I never dreamed of, such universal peace and good will and\n",
      "mutual affection.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, well, of course, if you like a perpetual Sunday school, it’s all\n",
      "very well. But I like Something Doing. Here it’s all done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something to this criticism. The years of pioneering lay far\n",
      "behind them. Theirs was a civilization in which the initial difficulties\n",
      "had long since been overcome. The untroubled peace, the unmeasured\n",
      "plenty, the steady health, the large good will and smooth management\n",
      "which ordered everything, left nothing to overcome. It was like a\n",
      "pleasant family in an old established, perfectly run country place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked it because of my eager and continued interest in the\n",
      "sociological achievements involved. Jeff liked it as he would have liked\n",
      "such a family and such a place anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry did not like it because he found nothing to oppose, to struggle\n",
      "with, to conquer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Life is a struggle, has to be,” he insisted. “If there is no struggle,\n",
      "there is no life--that’s all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re talking nonsense--masculine nonsense,” the peaceful Jeff\n",
      "replied. He was certainly a warm defender of Herland. “Ants don’t raise\n",
      "their myriads by a struggle, do they? Or the bees?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, if you go back to insects--and want to live in an anthill--! I tell\n",
      "you the higher grades of life are reached only through struggle--combat.\n",
      "There’s no Drama here. Look at their plays! They make me sick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He rather had us there. The drama of the country was--to our\n",
      "taste--rather flat. You see, they lacked the sex motive and, with it,\n",
      "jealousy. They had no interplay of warring nations, no aristocracy and\n",
      "its ambitions, no wealth and poverty opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see I have said little about the economics of the place; it should\n",
      "have come before, but I’ll go on about the drama now.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had their own kind. There was a most impressive array of pageantry,\n",
      "of processions, a sort of grand ritual, with their arts and their\n",
      "religion broadly blended. The very babies joined in it. To see one of\n",
      "their great annual festivals, with the massed and marching stateliness\n",
      "of those great mothers, the young women brave and noble, beautiful and\n",
      "strong; and then the children, taking part as naturally as ours would\n",
      "frolic round a Christmas tree--it was overpowering in the impression of\n",
      "joyous, triumphant life.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had begun at a period when the drama, the dance, music, religion,\n",
      "and education were all very close together; and instead of developing\n",
      "them in detached lines, they had kept the connection. Let me try again\n",
      "to give, if I can, a faint sense of the difference in the life view--the\n",
      "background and basis on which their culture rested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ellador told me a lot about it. She took me to see the children, the\n",
      "growing girls, the special teachers. She picked out books for me to\n",
      "read. She always seemed to understand just what I wanted to know, and\n",
      "how to give it to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Terry and Alima struck sparks and parted--he always madly drawn\n",
      "to her and she to him--she must have been, or she’d never have stood the\n",
      "way he behaved--Ellador and I had already a deep, restful feeling, as\n",
      "if we’d always had one another. Jeff and Celis were happy; there was no\n",
      "question of that; but it didn’t seem to me as if they had the good times\n",
      "we did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, here is the Herland child facing life--as Ellador tried to show\n",
      "it to me. From the first memory, they knew Peace, Beauty, Order, Safety,\n",
      "Love, Wisdom, Justice, Patience, and Plenty. By “plenty” I mean that the\n",
      "babies grew up in an environment which met their needs, just as young\n",
      "fawns might grow up in dewy forest glades and brook-fed meadows. And\n",
      "they enjoyed it as frankly and utterly as the fawns would.\n",
      "\n",
      "They found themselves in a big bright lovely world, full of the most\n",
      "interesting and enchanting things to learn about and to do. The people\n",
      "everywhere were friendly and polite. No Herland child ever met the\n",
      "overbearing rudeness we so commonly show to children. They were People,\n",
      "too, from the first; the most precious part of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In each step of the rich experience of living, they found the instance\n",
      "they were studying widen out into contact with an endless range of\n",
      "common interests. The things they learned were RELATED, from the first;\n",
      "related to one another, and to the national prosperity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a butterfly that made me a forester,” said Ellador. “I was about\n",
      "eleven years old, and I found a big purple-and-green butterfly on a low\n",
      "flower. I caught it, very carefully, by the closed wings, as I had been\n",
      "told to do, and carried it to the nearest insect teacher”--I made a note\n",
      "there to ask her what on earth an insect teacher was--“to ask her its\n",
      "name. She took it from me with a little cry of delight. ‘Oh, you blessed\n",
      "child,’ she said. ‘Do you like obernuts?’ Of course I liked obernuts,\n",
      "and said so. It is our best food-nut, you know. ‘This is a female of the\n",
      "obernut moth,’ she told me. ‘They are almost gone. We have been trying\n",
      "to exterminate them for centuries. If you had not caught this one, it\n",
      "might have laid eggs enough to raise worms enough to destroy thousands\n",
      "of our nut trees--thousands of bushels of nuts--and make years and years\n",
      "of trouble for us.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody congratulated me. The children all over the country were told\n",
      "to watch for that moth, if there were any more. I was shown the history\n",
      "of the creature, and an account of the damage it used to do and of how\n",
      "long and hard our foremothers had worked to save that tree for us. I\n",
      "grew a foot, it seemed to me, and determined then and there to be a\n",
      "forester.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This is but an instance; she showed me many. The big difference was that\n",
      "whereas our children grow up in private homes and families, with every\n",
      "effort made to protect and seclude them from a dangerous world, here\n",
      "they grew up in a wide, friendly world, and knew it for theirs, from the\n",
      "first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their child-literature was a wonderful thing. I could have spent years\n",
      "following the delicate subtleties, the smooth simplicities with which\n",
      "they had bent that great art to the service of the child mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have two life cycles: the man’s and the woman’s. To the man there is\n",
      "growth, struggle, conquest, the establishment of his family, and as much\n",
      "further success in gain or ambition as he can achieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the woman, growth, the securing of a husband, the subordinate\n",
      "activities of family life, and afterward such “social” or charitable\n",
      "interests as her position allows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was but one cycle, and that a large one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The child entered upon a broad open field of life, in which motherhood\n",
      "was the one great personal contribution to the national life, and all\n",
      "the rest the individual share in their common activities. Every girl I\n",
      "talked to, at any age above babyhood, had her cheerful determination as\n",
      "to what she was going to be when she grew up.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Terry meant by saying they had no “modesty” was that this great\n",
      "life-view had no shady places; they had a high sense of personal\n",
      "decorum, but no shame--no knowledge of anything to be ashamed of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even their shortcomings and misdeeds in childhood never were presented\n",
      "to them as sins; merely as errors and misplays--as in a game. Some of\n",
      "them, who were palpably less agreeable than others or who had a real\n",
      "weakness or fault, were treated with cheerful allowance, as a friendly\n",
      "group at whist would treat a poor player.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their religion, you see, was maternal; and their ethics, based on the\n",
      "full perception of evolution, showed the principle of growth and the\n",
      "beauty of wise culture. They had no theory of the essential opposition\n",
      "of good and evil; life to them was growth; their pleasure was in\n",
      "growing, and their duty also.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this background, with their sublimated mother-love, expressed in\n",
      "terms of widest social activity, every phase of their work was modified\n",
      "by its effect on the national growth. The language itself they had\n",
      "deliberately clarified, simplified, made easy and beautiful, for the\n",
      "sake of the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to us a wholly incredible thing: first, that any nation\n",
      "should have the foresight, the strength, and the persistence to plan\n",
      "and fulfill such a task; and second, that women should have had so much\n",
      "initiative. We have assumed, as a matter of course, that women had\n",
      "none; that only the man, with his natural energy and impatience of\n",
      "restriction, would ever invent anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we found that the pressure of life upon the environment develops in\n",
      "the human mind its inventive reactions, regardless of sex; and further,\n",
      "that a fully awakened motherhood plans and works without limit, for the\n",
      "good of the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "That the children might be most nobly born, and reared in an environment\n",
      "calculated to allow the richest, freest growth, they had deliberately\n",
      "remodeled and improved the whole state.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not mean in the least that they stopped at that, any more than\n",
      "a child stops at childhood. The most impressive part of their whole\n",
      "culture beyond this perfect system of child-rearing was the range of\n",
      "interests and associations open to them all, for life. But in the field\n",
      "of literature I was most struck, at first, by the child-motive.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had the same gradation of simple repetitive verse and story that we\n",
      "are familiar with, and the most exquisite, imaginative tales; but where,\n",
      "with us, these are the dribbled remnants of ancient folk myths and\n",
      "primitive lullabies, theirs were the exquisite work of great artists;\n",
      "not only simple and unfailing in appeal to the child-mind, but TRUE,\n",
      "true to the living world about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sit in one of their nurseries for a day was to change one’s views\n",
      "forever as to babyhood. The youngest ones, rosy fatlings in their\n",
      "mothers’ arms, or sleeping lightly in the flower-sweet air, seemed\n",
      "natural enough, save that they never cried. I never heard a child cry in\n",
      "Herland, save once or twice at a bad fall; and then people ran to help,\n",
      "as we would at a scream of agony from a grown person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each mother had her year of glory; the time to love and learn, living\n",
      "closely with her child, nursing it proudly, often for two years or more.\n",
      "This perhaps was one reason for their wonderful vigor.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after the baby-year the mother was not so constantly in attendance,\n",
      "unless, indeed, her work was among the little ones. She was never\n",
      "far off, however, and her attitude toward the co-mothers, whose proud\n",
      "child-service was direct and continuous, was lovely to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the babies--a group of those naked darlings playing on short\n",
      "velvet grass, clean-swept; or rugs as soft; or in shallow pools of\n",
      "bright water; tumbling over with bubbling joyous baby laughter--it was a\n",
      "view of infant happiness such as I had never dreamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The babies were reared in the warmer part of the country, and gradually\n",
      "acclimated to the cooler heights as they grew older.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sturdy children of ten and twelve played in the snow as joyfully as ours\n",
      "do; there were continuous excursions of them, from one part of the land\n",
      "to another, so that to each child the whole country might be home.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all theirs, waiting for them to learn, to love, to use, to serve;\n",
      "as our own little boys plan to be “a big soldier,” or “a cowboy,” or\n",
      "whatever pleases their fancy; and our little girls plan for the kind of\n",
      "home they mean to have, or how many children; these planned, freely and\n",
      "gaily with much happy chattering, of what they would do for the country\n",
      "when they were grown.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the eager happiness of the children and young people which first\n",
      "made me see the folly of that common notion of ours--that if life was\n",
      "smooth and happy, people would not enjoy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I studied these youngsters, vigorous, joyous, eager little creatures,\n",
      "and their voracious appetite for life, it shook my previous ideas so\n",
      "thoroughly that they have never been re-established. The steady level of\n",
      "good health gave them all that natural stimulus we used to call “animal\n",
      "spirits”--an odd contradiction in terms. They found themselves in an\n",
      "immediate environment which was agreeable and interesting, and before\n",
      "them stretched the years of learning and discovery, the fascinating,\n",
      "endless process of education.\n",

      "Ellador could not understand my astonishment. She explained things\n",
      "kindly and sweetly, but with some amazement that they needed explaining,\n",
      "and with sudden questions as to how we did it that left me meeker than\n",
      "ever.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I had not thought of that. We say: “All the world loves a lover,” but\n",

      "“Tell me about your theory of education,” I said. “Make it short and\n",
      "easy. And, to show you what puzzles me, I’ll tell you that in our theory\n",
      "great stress is laid on the forced exertion of the child’s mind; we\n",
      "think it is good for him to overcome obstacles.”\n",

      "educational?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our theory is this,” she went on carefully. “Here is a young human\n",
      "being. The mind is as natural a thing as the body, a thing that grows,\n",
      "a thing to use and enjoy. We seek to nourish, to stimulate, to exercise\n",
      "the mind of a child as we do the body. There are the two main divisions\n",
      "in education--you have those of course?--the things it is necessary to\n",
      "know, and the things it is necessary to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To do? Mental exercises, you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. Our general plan is this: In the matter of feeding the mind,\n",
      "of furnishing information, we use our best powers to meet the natural\n",
      "appetite of a healthy young brain; not to overfeed it, to provide such\n",
      "amount and variety of impressions as seem most welcome to each child.\n",
      "That is the easiest part. The other division is in arranging a properly\n",
      "graduated series of exercises which will best develop each mind; the\n",
      "common faculties we all have, and most carefully, the especial faculties\n",
      "some of us have. You do this also, do you not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a way,” I said rather lamely. “We have not so subtle and highly\n",

      "out, extremely limited in knowledge. I wish you could realize what a\n",
      "ferment the country is in over the new things you have told us; the\n",
      "passionate eagerness among thousands of us to go to your country and\n",
      "learn--learn--learn! But what we do know is readily divisible into\n",
      "common knowledge and special knowledge. The common knowledge we have\n",
      "long since learned to feed into the minds of our little ones with no\n",
      "waste of time or strength; the special knowledge is open to all, as\n",
      "they desire it. Some of us specialize in one line only. But most take up\n",

      "\n",
      "“To grow with?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. When one settles too close in one kind of work there is a tendency\n",

      "learning, always.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you study?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As much as we know of the different sciences. We have, within our\n",

      "the succeeding and improving generations. We are at work, slowly and\n",
      "carefully, developing our whole people along these lines. It is glorious\n",
      "work--splendid! To see the thousands of babies improving, showing\n",

      "you find it so in your country?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This I evaded flatly. I remembered the cheerless claim that the human\n",

      "\n",
      "“As part of your system of education, you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly. As the most valuable part. With the babies, as you may have\n",
      "noticed, we first provide an environment which feeds the mind without\n",
      "tiring it; all manner of simple and interesting things to do, as soon\n",
      "as they are old enough to do them; physical properties, of course, come\n",
      "first. But as early as possible, going very carefully, not to tax the\n",
      "mind, we provide choices, simple choices, with very obvious causes and\n",
      "consequences. You’ve noticed the games?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had. The children seemed always playing something; or else, sometimes,\n",
      "engaged in peaceful researches of their own. I had wondered at first\n",
      "when they went to school, but soon found that they never did--to their\n",
      "knowledge. It was all education but no schooling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have been working for some sixteen hundred years, devising better\n",
      "and better games for children,” continued Somel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat aghast. “Devising games?” I protested. “Making up new ones, you\n",
      "mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly,” she answered. “Don’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I remembered the kindergarten, and the “material” devised by\n",
      "Signora Montessori, and guardedly replied: “To some extent.” But most\n",
      "of our games, I told her, were very old--came down from child to child,\n",
      "along the ages, from the remote past.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what is their effect?” she asked. “Do they develop the faculties\n",
      "you wish to encourage?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again I remembered the claims made by the advocates of “sports,” and\n",
      "again replied guardedly that that was, in part, the theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But do the children LIKE it?” I asked. “Having things made up and set\n",
      "before them that way? Don’t they want the old games?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can see the children,” she answered. “Are yours more\n",
      "contented--more interested--happier?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I thought, as in truth I never had thought before, of the dull,\n",
      "bored children I had seen, whining; “What can I do now?”; of the little\n",
      "groups and gangs hanging about; of the value of some one strong spirit\n",
      "who possessed initiative and would “start something”; of the children’s\n",
      "parties and the onerous duties of the older people set to “amuse the\n",
      "children”; also of that troubled ocean of misdirected activity we call\n",
      "“mischief,” the foolish, destructive, sometimes evil things done by\n",

      "The Herland child was born not only into a world carefully prepared,\n",
      "full of the most fascinating materials and opportunities to learn, but\n",
      "into the society of plentiful numbers of teachers, teachers born and\n",
      "trained, whose business it was to accompany the children along that, to\n",
      "us, impossible thing--the royal road to learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no mystery in their methods. Being adapted to children it was\n",
      "at least comprehensible to adults. I spent many days with the little\n",
      "ones, sometimes with Ellador, sometimes without, and began to feel a\n",
      "crushing pity for my own childhood, and for all others that I had known.\n",
      "\n",
      "The houses and gardens planned for babies had in them nothing to\n",
      "hurt--no stairs, no corners, no small loose objects to swallow, no\n",
      "fire--just a babies’ paradise. They were taught, as rapidly as\n",
      "feasible, to use and control their own bodies, and never did I see such\n",
      "sure-footed, steady-handed, clear-headed little things. It was a joy\n",
      "to watch a row of toddlers learning to walk, not only on a level floor,\n",
      "but, a little later, on a sort of rubber rail raised an inch or two\n",
      "above the soft turf or heavy rugs, and falling off with shrieks of\n",
      "infant joy, to rush back to the end of the line and try again. Surely we\n",
      "have noticed how children love to get up on something and walk along it!\n",
      "But we have never thought to provide that simple and inexhaustible form\n",
      "of amusement and physical education for the young.\n",
      "\n",
      "Water they had, of course, and could swim even before they walked. If I\n",
      "feared at first the effects of a too intensive system of culture, that\n",
      "fear was dissipated by seeing the long sunny days of pure physical\n",
      "merriment and natural sleep in which these heavenly babies passed their\n",
      "first years. They never knew they were being educated. They did not\n",
      "dream that in this association of hilarious experiment and achievement\n",
      "they were laying the foundation for that close beautiful group feeling\n",
      "into which they grew so firmly with the years. This was education for\n",

      "When I asked her about it, she tried at first to tell me, and then,\n",
      "seeing me flounder, asked for more information about ours. She soon\n",
      "found that we had many, that they varied widely, but had some points\n",
      "in common. A clear methodical luminous mind had my Ellador, not only\n",
      "reasonable, but swiftly perceptive.\n",
      "\n",
      "She made a sort of chart, superimposing the different religions as\n",
      "I described them, with a pin run through them all, as it were; their\n",
      "common basis being a Dominant Power or Powers, and some Special\n",
      "Behavior, mostly taboos, to please or placate. There were some common\n",
      "features in certain groups of religions, but the one always present was\n",
      "this Power, and the things which must be done or not done because of\n",
      "it. It was not hard to trace our human imagery of the Divine Force up\n",
      "through successive stages of bloodthirsty, sensual, proud, and cruel\n",
      "gods of early times to the conception of a Common Father with its\n",
      "corollary of a Common Brotherhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pleased her very much, and when I expatiated on the Omniscience,\n",
      "Omnipotence, Omnipresence, and so on, of our God, and of the loving\n",
      "kindness taught by his Son, she was much impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story of the Virgin birth naturally did not astonish her, but she\n",

      "the theory of Damnation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When in an inadvertent moment I said that certain sects had believed in\n",

      "\n",
      "“And yet that such a God could put little new babies to burn--for\n",
      "eternity?” She fell into a sudden shuddering and left me, running\n",
      "swiftly to the nearest temple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every smallest village had its temple, and in those gracious retreats\n",
      "sat wise and noble women, quietly busy at some work of their own until\n",
      "they were wanted, always ready to give comfort, light, or help, to any\n",
      "applicant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ellador told me afterward how easily this grief of hers was assuaged,\n",
      "and seemed ashamed of not having helped herself out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, we are not accustomed to horrible ideas,” she said, coming\n",
      "back to me rather apologetically. “We haven’t any. And when we get a\n",
      "thing like that into our minds it’s like--oh, like red pepper in your\n",
      "eyes. So I just ran to her, blinded and almost screaming, and she took\n",
      "it out so quickly--so easily!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How?” I asked, very curious.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Why, you blessed child,’ she said, ‘you’ve got the wrong idea\n",

      "there wasn’t. Or such a happening--for there wasn’t. Nor even that this\n",

      "before.’”\n",

      "said it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a lesson to me. No wonder this whole nation of women was\n",

      "\n",

      "unworthy of the children who must go beyond us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This set me thinking in good earnest. I had always imagined--simply from\n",
      "hearing it said, I suppose--that women were by nature conservative. Yet\n",
      "these women, quite unassisted by any masculine spirit of enterprise, had\n",
      "ignored their past and built daringly for the future.\n",

      "on in my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s because we began in a new way, I suppose. All our folks were swept\n",
      "away at once, and then, after that time of despair, came those wonder\n",
      "children--the first. And then the whole breathless hope of us was for\n",
      "THEIR children--if they should have them. And they did! Then there was\n",
      "the period of pride and triumph till we grew too numerous; and after\n",
      "that, when it all came down to one child apiece, we began to really\n",
      "work--to make better ones.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how does this account for such a radical difference in your\n",
      "religion?” I persisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said she couldn’t talk about the difference very intelligently,\n",
      "not being familiar with other religions, but that theirs seemed simple\n",
      "enough. Their great Mother Spirit was to them what their own motherhood\n",
      "was--only magnified beyond human limits. That meant that they\n",
      "felt beneath and behind them an upholding, unfailing, serviceable\n",
      "love--perhaps it was really the accumulated mother-love of the race they\n",
      "felt--but it was a Power.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Worship? What is that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I found it singularly difficult to explain. This Divine Love which they\n",
      "felt so strongly did not seem to ask anything of them--“any more than\n",
      "our mothers do,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But surely your mothers expect honor, reverence, obedience, from you.\n",
      "You have to do things for your mothers, surely?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, no,” she insisted, smiling, shaking her soft brown hair. “We do\n",
      "things FROM our mothers--not FOR them. We don’t have to do things\n",
      "FOR them--they don’t need it, you know. But we have to live\n",
      "on--splendidly--because of them; and that’s the way we feel about God.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I meditated again. I thought of that God of Battles of ours,\n",
      "that Jealous God, that Vengeance-is-mine God. I thought of our\n",

      "\n",
      "“You have no theory of eternal punishment then, I take it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ellador laughed. Her eyes were as bright as stars, and there were tears\n",
      "in them, too. She was so sorry for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How could we?” she asked, fairly enough. “We have no punishments in\n",
      "life, you see, so we don’t imagine them after death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you NO punishments? Neither for children nor criminals--such mild\n",
      "criminals as you have?” I urged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you punish a person for a broken leg or a fever? We have preventive\n",
      "measures, and cures; sometimes we have to ‘send the patient to bed,’ as\n",
      "it were; but that’s not a punishment--it’s only part of the treatment,”\n",
      " she explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then studying my point of view more closely, she added: “You see, we\n",
      "recognize, in our human motherhood, a great tender limitless uplifting\n",
      "force--patience and wisdom and all subtlety of delicate method. We\n",
      "credit God--our idea of God--with all that and more. Our mothers are not\n",
      "angry with us--why should God be?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does God mean a person to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This she thought over a little. “Why--in trying to get close to it in\n",
      "our minds we personify the idea, naturally; but we certainly do\n",
      "not assume a Big Woman somewhere, who is God. What we call God is a\n",
      "Pervading Power, you know, an Indwelling Spirit, something inside of us\n",
      "that we want more of. Is your God a Big Man?” she asked innocently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why--yes, to most of us, I think. Of course we call it an Indwelling\n",
      "Spirit just as you do, but we insist that it is Him, a Person, and a\n",
      "Man--with whiskers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whiskers? Oh yes--because you have them! Or do you wear them because He\n",
      "does?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the contrary, we shave them off--because it seems cleaner and more\n",
      "comfortable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does He wear clothes--in your idea, I mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was thinking over the pictures of God I had seen--rash advances of the\n",
      "devout mind of man, representing his Omnipotent Deity as an old man in\n",
      "a flowing robe, flowing hair, flowing beard, and in the light of her\n",
      "perfectly frank and innocent questions this concept seemed rather\n",
      "unsatisfying.\n",
      "\n",
      "I explained that the God of the Christian world was really the ancient\n",
      "Hebrew God, and that we had simply taken over the patriarchal idea--that\n",
      "ancient one which quite inevitably clothed its thought of God with the\n",
      "attributes of the patriarchal ruler, the grandfather.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see,” she said eagerly, after I had explained the genesis and\n",
      "development of our religious ideals. “They lived in separate groups,\n",
      "with a male head, and he was probably a little--domineering?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No doubt of that,” I agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And we live together without any ‘head,’ in that sense--just our chosen\n",
      "leaders--that DOES make a difference.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your difference is deeper than that,” I assured her. “It is in your\n",
      "common motherhood. Your children grow up in a world where everybody\n",
      "loves them. They find life made rich and happy for them by the diffused\n",
      "love and wisdom of all mothers. So it is easy for you to think of God in\n",
      "the terms of a similar diffused and competent love. I think you are far\n",
      "nearer right than we are.”\n",

      "it to mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Apart from that,” she pursued, “what I cannot understand is why you\n",

      "\n",
      "“Pretty generally,” I agreed. “But this we call ‘revealed religion,’\n",

      "They developed their central theory of a Loving Power, and assumed that\n",
      "its relation to them was motherly--that it desired their welfare and\n",
      "especially their development. Their relation to it, similarly, was\n",
      "filial, a loving appreciation and a glad fulfillment of its high\n",
      "purposes. Then, being nothing if not practical, they set their keen\n",
      "and active minds to discover the kind of conduct expected of them. This\n",
      "worked out in a most admirable system of ethics. The principle of Love\n",
      "was universally recognized--and used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patience, gentleness, courtesy, all that we call “good breeding,” was\n",
      "part of their code of conduct. But where they went far beyond us was\n",
      "in the special application of religious feeling to every field of\n",
      "life. They had no ritual, no little set of performances called “divine\n",
      "service,” save those religious pageants I have spoken of, and those were\n",
      "as much educational as religious, and as much social as either. But they\n",
      "had a clear established connection between everything they did--and\n",
      "God. Their cleanliness, their health, their exquisite order, the rich\n",
      "peaceful beauty of the whole land, the happiness of the children, and\n",
      "above all the constant progress they made--all this was their religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "They applied their minds to the thought of God, and worked out the\n",
      "theory that such an inner power demanded outward expression. They lived\n",
      "as if God was real and at work within them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for those little temples everywhere--some of the women were more\n",
      "skilled, more temperamentally inclined, in this direction, than others.\n",
      "These, whatever their work might be, gave certain hours to the Temple\n",
      "Service, which meant being there with all their love and wisdom and\n",
      "trained thought, to smooth out rough places for anyone who needed it.\n",
      "Sometimes it was a real grief, very rarely a quarrel, most often a\n",
      "perplexity; even in Herland the human soul had its hours of darkness.\n",

      "help.\n",

      "If the difficulty was unusually profound, the applicant was directed to\n",
      "someone more specially experienced in that line of thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was a religion which gave to the searching mind a rational basis\n",
      "in life, the concept of an immense Loving Power working steadily out\n",
      "through them, toward good. It gave to the “soul” that sense of contact\n",
      "with the inmost force, of perception of the uttermost purpose, which we\n",
      "always crave. It gave to the “heart” the blessed feeling of being loved,\n",
      "loved and UNDERSTOOD. It gave clear, simple, rational directions as\n",
      "to how we should live--and why. And for ritual it gave first those\n",
      "triumphant group demonstrations, when with a union of all the arts,\n",
      "the revivifying combination of great multitudes moved rhythmically with\n",
      "march and dance, song and music, among their own noblest products\n",
      "and the open beauty of their groves and hills. Second, it gave these\n",

      "promulgated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here?” asked Ellador. “Never to die--here?” I could see her practical\n",
      "mind heaping up the people, and hurriedly reassured her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh no, indeed, not here--hereafter. We must die here, of course, but\n",

      "\n",
      "“How do you know?” she inquired.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“You couldn’t be anything else,” I said, half gladly and half a little\n",
      "sorry. The transparent honesty of these women was a never-ending\n",
      "astonishment to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It seems to me a singularly foolish idea,” she said calmly. “And if\n",
      "true, most disagreeable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I had always accepted the doctrine of personal immortality as\n",
      "a thing established. The efforts of inquiring spiritualists, always\n",
      "seeking to woo their beloved ghosts back again, never seemed to me\n",
      "necessary. I don’t say I had ever seriously and courageously discussed\n",
      "the subject with myself even; I had simply assumed it to be a fact.\n",
      "And here was the girl I loved, this creature whose character constantly\n",
      "revealed new heights and ranges far beyond my own, this superwoman of a\n",
      "superland, saying she thought immortality foolish! She meant it, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you WANT it for?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can you NOT want it!” I protested. “Do you want to go out like a\n",

      "forever?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, no,” she said. “I don’t in the least. I want my child--and my\n",
      "child’s child--to go on--and they will. Why should _I_ want to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it means Heaven!” I insisted. “Peace and Beauty and Comfort\n",
      "and Love--with God.” I had never been so eloquent on the subject of\n",
      "religion. She could be horrified at Damnation, and question the justice\n",
      "of Salvation, but Immortality--that was surely a noble faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Van,” she said, holding out her hands to me. “Why Van--darling!\n",

      "ourselves--their all-too-perfect civilization, but when it came to\n",
      "telling them about the failures and wastes of our own, we never could\n",
      "bring ourselves to do it.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Of course they haven’t any marriage ceremony or service, but we can\n",

      "\n",
      "It was. There was so little, after all, that we could do for them. Here\n",

      "ceremony, civil and religious, that joins the two together--‘until death\n",

      "“Do your women have no names before they are married?” Celis suddenly\n",
      "demanded.\n",

      "\n",

      "“Change them? Do the husbands then take the wives’ ‘maiden names’?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, no,” he laughed. “The man keeps his own and gives it to her, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then she just loses hers and takes a new one--how unpleasant! We won’t\n",
      "do that!” Alima said decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry was good-humored about it. “I don’t care what you do or don’t do\n",
      "so long as we have that wedding pretty soon,” he said, reaching a strong\n",
      "brown hand after Alima’s, quite as brown and nearly as strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to giving us things--of course we can see that you’d like to, but\n",
      "we are glad you can’t,” Celis continued. “You see, we love you just for\n",

      "know that you are loved personally--and just as men?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Enough or not, that was the way we were married. We had a great triple\n",
      "wedding in the biggest temple of all, and it looked as if most of the\n",
      "nation was present. It was very solemn and very beautiful. Someone had\n",
      "written a new song for the occasion, nobly beautiful, about the New Hope\n",
      "for their people--the New Tie with other lands--Brotherhood as well as\n",
      "Sisterhood, and, with evident awe, Fatherhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry was always restive under their talk of fatherhood. “Anybody’d\n",

      "suggestions, often quite useful, as well as the wise foresight I have\n",

      "I found an endlessly beautiful undiscovered country to explore, and in\n",

      "some new place and people, with a desire to eat at all hours, and no\n",
      "other interests in particular; and as if my hosts, instead of merely\n",
      "saying, “You shall not eat,” had presently aroused in me a lively desire\n",
      "for music, for pictures, for games, for exercise, for playing in the\n",
      "water, for running some ingenious machine; and, in the multitude of my\n",
      "satisfactions, I forgot the one point which was not satisfied, and got\n",
      "along very well until mealtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the cleverest and most ingenious of these tricks was only clear\n",
      "to me many years after, when we were so wholly at one on this subject\n",
      "that I could laugh at my own predicament then. It was this: You see,\n",
      "with us, women are kept as different as possible and as feminine as\n",
      "possible. We men have our own world, with only men in it; we get tired\n",
      "of our ultra-maleness and turn gladly to the ultra-femaleness. Also,\n",
      "in keeping our women as feminine as possible, we see to it that when\n",
      "we turn to them we find the thing we want always in evidence. Well, the\n",
      "atmosphere of this place was anything but seductive. The very numbers\n",
      "of these human women, always in human relation, made them anything\n",
      "but alluring. When, in spite of this, my hereditary instincts and\n",
      "race-traditions made me long for the feminine response in Ellador,\n",
      "instead of withdrawing so that I should want her more, she deliberately\n",
      "gave me a little too much of her society.--always de-feminized, as it\n",
      "were. It was awfully funny, really.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was I, with an Ideal in mind, for which I hotly longed, and here\n",
      "was she, deliberately obtruding in the foreground of my consciousness a\n",
      "Fact--a fact which I coolly enjoyed, but which actually interfered with\n",
      "what I wanted. I see now clearly enough why a certain kind of man, like\n",
      "Sir Almroth Wright, resents the professional development of women. It\n",
      "gets in the way of the sex ideal; it temporarily covers and excludes\n",
      "femininity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, in this case, I was so fond of Ellador my friend, of Ellador\n",
      "my professional companion, that I necessarily enjoyed her society on any\n",
      "terms. Only--when I had had her with me in her de-feminine capacity for\n",
      "a sixteen-hour day, I could go to my own room and sleep without dreaming\n",
      "about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The witch! If ever anybody worked to woo and win and hold a human soul,\n",
      "she did, great superwoman that she was. I couldn’t then half comprehend\n",
      "the skill of it, the wonder. But this I soon began to find: that under\n",
      "all our cultivated attitude of mind toward women, there is an older,\n",
      "deeper, more “natural” feeling, the restful reverence which looks up to\n",
      "the Mother sex.\n",

      "a psychologist as Ellador, and what’s more, I think she had a\n",
      "far-descended atavistic trace of more marked femaleness, never apparent\n",

      "wishing to put the best foot foremost for our civilization, in the face\n",
      "of the beauty and comfort of theirs. Also, we really thought some things\n",
      "were right, or at least unavoidable, which we could readily see would be\n",

      "to be out of it all. It made him sick, he said, SICK; this everlasting\n",
      "mother-mother-mothering. I don’t think Terry had what the phrenologists\n",

      "\n",
      "“Morbid one-sided cripples,” he called them, even when from his window\n",
      "he could see their splendid vigor and beauty; even while Moadine, as\n",
      "patient and friendly as if she had never helped Alima to hold and bind\n",
      "him, sat there in the room, the picture of wisdom and serene strength.\n",
      "“Sexless, epicene, undeveloped neuters!” he went on bitterly. He sounded\n",
      "like Sir Almwroth Wright.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well--it was hard. He was madly in love with Alima, really; more so than\n",
      "he had ever been before, and their tempestuous courtship, quarrels, and\n",
      "reconciliations had fanned the flame. And then when he sought by that\n",
      "supreme conquest which seems so natural a thing to that type of man, to\n",
      "force her to love him as her master--to have the sturdy athletic furious\n",

      "Come to think of it, I do not recall a similar case in all history or\n",
      "fiction. Women have killed themselves rather than submit to outrage;\n",
      "they have killed the outrager; they have escaped; or they have\n",
      "submitted--sometimes seeming to get on very well with the victor\n",
      "afterward. There was that adventure of “false Sextus,” for instance,\n",
      "who “found Lucrese combing the fleece, under the midnight lamp.” He\n",
      "threatened, as I remember, that if she did not submit he would slay her,\n",
      "slay a slave and place him beside her and say he found him there. A poor\n",
      "device, it always seemed to me. If Mr. Lucretius had asked him how he\n",
      "came to be in his wife’s bedroom overlooking her morals, what could he\n",
      "have said? But the point is Lucrese submitted, and Alima didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She kicked me,” confided the embittered prisoner--he had to talk to\n",
      "someone. “I was doubled up with the pain, of course, and she jumped on\n",
      "me and yelled for this old harpy [Moadine couldn’t hear him] and they\n",
      "had me trussed up in no time. I believe Alima could have done it alone,”\n",
      " he added with reluctant admiration. “She’s as strong as a horse. And\n",
      "of course a man’s helpless when you hit him like that. No woman with a\n",
      "shade of decency--”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had to grin at that, and even Terry did, sourly. He wasn’t given to\n",

      "considerations of decency.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d give a year of my life to have her alone again,” he said slowly,\n",
      "his hands clenched till the knuckles were white.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he never did. She left our end of the country entirely, went up into\n",
      "the fir-forest on the highest slopes, and stayed there. Before we left\n",
      "he quite desperately longed to see her, but she would not come and he\n",
      "could not go. They watched him like lynxes. (Do lynxes watch any better\n",
      "than mousing cats, I wonder!)\n",
      "\n",

      "lake, once we got started. We’d have gone gladly in a week’s time, of\n",
      "course, but there was a great to-do all over the country about\n",
      "Ellador’s leaving them. She had interviews with some of the leading\n",
      "ethicists--wise women with still eyes, and with the best of the\n",
      "teachers. There was a stir, a thrill, a deep excitement everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our teaching about the rest of the world has given them all a sense\n",
      "of isolation, of remoteness, of being a little outlying sample of a\n",
      "country, overlooked and forgotten among the family of nations. We had\n",
      "called it “the family of nations,” and they liked the phrase immensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were deeply aroused on the subject of evolution; indeed, the whole\n",
      "field of natural science drew them irresistibly. Any number of them\n",
      "would have risked everything to go to the strange unknown lands and\n",
      "study; but we could take only one, and it had to be Ellador, naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "We planned greatly about coming back, about establishing a connecting\n",
      "route by water; about penetrating those vast forests and civilizing--or\n",
      "exterminating--the dangerous savages. That is, we men talked of that\n",
      "last--not with the women. They had a definite aversion to killing\n",
      "things.\n",
      "\n",
      "But meanwhile there was high council being held among the wisest of them\n",
      "all. The students and thinkers who had been gathering facts from us all\n",
      "this time, collating and relating them, and making inferences, laid the\n",
      "result of their labors before the council.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little had we thought that our careful efforts at concealment had been\n",
      "so easily seen through, with never a word to show us that they saw. They\n",
      "had followed up words of ours on the science of optics, asked innocent\n",
      "questions about glasses and the like, and were aware of the defective\n",
      "eyesight so common among us.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the lightest touch, different women asking different questions at\n",
      "different times, and putting all our answers together like a picture\n",
      "puzzle, they had figured out a sort of skeleton chart as to the\n",
      "prevalence of disease among us. Even more subtly with no show of horror\n",
      "or condemnation, they had gathered something--far from the truth, but\n",
      "something pretty clear--about poverty, vice, and crime. They even had\n",
      "a goodly number of our dangers all itemized, from asking us about\n",
      "insurance and innocent things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were well posted as to the different races, beginning with their\n",
      "poison-arrow natives down below and widening out to the broad racial\n",
      "divisions we had told them about. Never a shocked expression of the face\n",
      "or exclamation of revolt had warned us; they had been extracting the\n",
      "evidence without our knowing it all this time, and now were studying\n",
      "with the most devout earnestness the matter they had prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result was rather distressing to us. They first explained the matter\n",
      "fully to Ellador, as she was the one who purposed visiting the Rest\n",
      "of the World. To Celis they said nothing. She must not be in any way\n",
      "distressed, while the whole nation waited on her Great Work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally Jeff and I were called in. Somel and Zava were there, and\n",
      "Ellador, with many others that we knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had a great globe, quite fairly mapped out from the small section\n",
      "maps in that compendium of ours. They had the different peoples of the\n",
      "earth roughly outlined, and their status in civilization indicated.\n",
      "They had charts and figures and estimates, based on the facts in that\n",
      "traitorous little book and what they had learned from us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somel explained: “We find that in all your historic period, so much\n",
      "longer than ours, that with all the interplay of services, the exchange\n",
      "of inventions and discoveries, and the wonderful progress we so admire,\n",
      "that in this widespread Other World of yours, there is still much\n",
      "disease, often contagious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We admitted this at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Also there is still, in varying degree, ignorance, with prejudice and\n",
      "unbridled emotion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This too was admitted.\n",
      "\n",

      "of wealth, that there is still unrest and sometimes combat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, yes, we admitted it all. We were used to these things and saw no\n",
      "reason for so much seriousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All things considered,” they said, and they did not say a hundredth\n",
      "part of the things they were considering, “we are unwilling to expose\n",
      "our country to free communication with the rest of the world--as yet. If\n",
      "Ellador comes back, and we approve her report, it may be done later--but\n",
      "not yet.\n",

First, we import the URLLIB package, and specifically the `request` module. We assign the URL we want to manipulate by assigning the URL to a variable. Next, we pass the URL through the urlopen.request function from the URLLIB package, and also at the same time \"read\" the file. The output of that string becomes the variable `html`. When we print the variable html, we discover that all of the HTML from the page has been pulled into the variable name. Unfortuantely, it doesn't look very clean. "

Johnson\\'s&nbsp;award-winning article about the role and work of Bishop Henry McNeal Turner in the Colored Conventions movement, focusing on the last convention called by Bishop Turner, the 1893 National Colored Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio.</span><span> The exhibit situates Bishop Turner in the Colored Conventions movement as a leader whose deep commitment to the work and value of nineteenth-century</span><span>&nbsp;Black activism manifested in a variety of venues: convention work, the Black Press, his visionary dedication both to African emigration and reparations, and perhaps most compelling, his signal contribution to the development and articulation of Black theology in his uncompromising explanation of the existence and relevance of a Black, Judeo-Christian &ldquo;God of the Oppressed.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>\\r\\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As is true for many African-American founding fathers, statesmen and elders, Bishop McNeal Turner&rsquo;s impact does not register in American secular histories, including his incredible influence and participation at Colored Conventions. This exhibit engages the work of recovery, reinsertion, and reclamation so central to the work of (Black) historians and archivists. The resounding silences that accompany Bishop Turner&rsquo;s name are particularly grievous. Bishop Turner&rsquo;s emigration and reparation work appears to have contributed to a curious muting and erasure that began in his lifetime, but reverberates into the contemporary moment. African emigration is fueled by a deep critique of the potential for American society to offer African Americans equal rights and justice. The contemporary relevance of reparations as a way to force America to recognize and account for its&rsquo; failure highlights the radical visionary work, life, and legacy of Bishop McNeal Turner. </span></p>\\r\\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b45ce1bc-ba21-b294-ada5-f0f97f575db8\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b45ce1bc-ba21-b294-ada5-f0f97f575db8\">Using excerpts from <em>The&nbsp;</em></span><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b45ce1bc-ba21-b294-ada5-f0f97f575db8\"><em>Christian Recorder</em>,</span><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b45ce1bc-ba21-b294-ada5-f0f97f575db8\">&nbsp;the following pages will demonstrate&nbsp;Bishop Turner&rsquo;s well established and hard earned reputation as a premier Black leader both within the convention movement and without.

The men on the network map represent both Colored Convention stalwarts and nationally and internationally known African American activists: Frederick Douglass, George Downing, Sella Martin among others. Bishop Turner was a highly respected leader in the African American community having proven himself as an orator, preacher, writer, activist, and consummate professional. Bishop Turner was the second African American Chaplain in the Armed Forces, an agent for the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau, a State Constitutional delegate and State Representative for Georgia, the first African American Postmaster General in Georgia, newspaper founder, editor and correspondent, and the first southern Bishop in the AME church. The AME Church recognizes Bishop Turner as the fourth and final horseman of the AME church. The Church gives this distinction to four Bishops: Allen, Payne, Quinn, and Turner whose lives are examples of excellence and service that transformed and strengthened the AME church, African American community, and the African diaspora.</span></span></span></span></p>\\r\\n<p>___________</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Curators</strong>: Denise Burgher, PhD student in English and Committee Chair, the Colored Conventions Project, and Dr. Andre Johnson, Assistant Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Memphis.&nbsp;<span>Created for Dr. P.

I heard a very instruc\\ntive and interesting.talk by Prof. Mc\\nClintock at the Lawndaje Civic Cen\\nter on \\\"The Value of Popular\\nPoetry.\\\" \\\"The greatest art of the\\npoet,\\\" said the learned professor, \\\"is\\nto study popular taste and give them\\nwhat they want\\\"\\nIt is unfortunate that the classes\\nunderstand so well the psychology of\\nthe masses and are therefore able to\\nplay upon their emotion as a musi\\ncian plays upon a harp. They feed\\nthem with poetry which appeals to\\nthe most ingrained prejudices of\\nman.\\nPoetry is not creative at best That\\nis, it does not .teach nor discover\\noriginal ideas; it either tends to ap\\npeal to the emotions and prejudices\\nof the race, or it revolves round some\\nprogressive idea as a sattelite and\\nhelps to inspire humanitarians to\\nfight until they have reached their\\ngoal.\\nPopular poetry is not poetry which\\nappeals wholly to the primitive feel\\nings of man, as that appeals to all\\nsections of mankind. The poetry the\\npeople are fed with is such as tend\\nto aid to perpetuate existing institu\\ntions.. The prpfessor said that the people\\nwere not intellectual but they are es\\nsentially sentimental. They like grue\\nsome and realistic tales. True, but\\nthe profesor failed to give the rea\\nsons for such popular taste.\\nTo the classes such taste appeals\\nto be low, popular and vulgar. For\\nit is easy for men who do not know\\nthe turmoils and strifes of life to\\nutter opinions on the low tastes and\\nsentimentality of the people. The\\nmasses find woe and sorrow at every\\nangle they turn. That is the reason\\nwhy woeful stories touch them. The\\nwealthy classes know of no other\\nwoes but that which nature imposes\\nupon them. The people suffer untold\\nmiseries which man imposes upon\\nman, hence their extreme sentimen\\ntality. The mental energies of the work\\ners exhausts itself in their daily\\ndrudgery and toil, therefore they do\\nnot think clearly upon their own in\\nterests. But a new and happier day\\nis dawning on the human horizon.\\nThe workers are demanding better\\nopportunities of self development and\\nfor self-expression. The spirit of as\\npiration animates them with the\\nsame zeal as it animated aristocratic\\nFaust, but the spirit of negation is\\nkeener in their case.\\nThe day will eventually dawn when,\\nthe titan of capitalism and oppres\\nsion will be conquered. Then \\\"The\\nAbysm will vomit forth the secrets\\nof nature\\\" even to the disinherited\\nmultitude. Sam Druck.\\nTEACHERS' HOURS. I have\\nheard so many confused statements\\nmade regarding the working hours of\\nteachers and their \\\"easy\\\" work that\\nI am constrained to give to those\\nwho \\\"desire truth and justice above\\nall things\\\" a real knowledge of the\\nactual facts.\\nAll teachers must be in their rooms\\nat 8:45 a. m. and 1 p. m. or be marked\\ntardy. This makes five and one-half\\nhours of compulsory work to begin\\nwith. The bookkeeping necessary\\nto -keeping records of attendance,\\npunctuality, grading and marking\\nexamination papers must be done out\\nof school hours.\\nIn every grade there is preparatory\\nwork to be done, so that every teach\\ner necessarily works from one to\\nthree hours more than the five and\\na half we started with. High school\\nteachers go on duty at least 15 min\\nutes before 9 a. m., have 30 minutes\\nfor lunch (and perhaps have to eat\\nthat in a study room in charge of\\nstudents.) High school closes at 3:30\\np. m., making six and three-quarter\\nhours' compulsory work, with an ad\\ndition to this of at least two hours'\\n-ini J3Kli:Lg's fNW\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\n",

What is more,\\nthe most of us are so occupied and\\nconditioned that we are compelled to\\ntake a daily ride on a car and like\\nwise to read the aforesaid poetry\\nwhether we like it or not. We may\\nrefuse for a time to glance at it, but\\na chcerless, stupid cage in which an\\nunwilling, ill-natured public was carted from place\\nto place. Now it is fast becoming a veritable cir\\nculating library of poetry and art on wheels. The\\npopulace enters then in with the happy assurance\\nthat while there is small likelihood of its finding an\\nunoccupied seat, it is sure of meeting with many a\\nquaint and curious quatrain of poetic lore calculated\\nto make those who must cling to straps forget all\\ntheir woes and worries in contemplating the plea\\nsant food for thought so temptingly displayed on\\neverv hand.\\nWe've heard about those signs so plain that \\\"he who runs\\nmay read'':\\nBut when it comes to street-ear ads , why, there we do not\\nneed\\nTo run a bit, but idlv sit, al! active movements shunning,\\nAs by the mile we ride the while the car does all the\\nrunning.\\nWith what curious interest the street-car patron\\nhas watched the subtle but all-conquering advance\\nof poetry into the cold commercial world that\\nwas once deemed to be the undisputed realm of\\nplain prose.\\nTime was when poetry was est' erned to be too\\nfragile, too timid, too polite, to appear in mixed\\nassemblages. In those dear old delicate days it\\nwas honestly supposed that a full breath of real\\nbusiness atmosphere would prove almost fatal\\nto a tender triolet or a retiring rondo. But the\\ntimes change, and we are changed with them.\\nNowadays it is no unusual sight to see a sweet,\\nsentinental sonnet and a brisk, business-like sand\\nwich going hand in hand, as it were, about the busy\\nthoroughfares of our bustling cities.\\nTo illustrate the manner in which poetry is over\\ncoming prose, let us take, for example, a certain\\nwell-known brand of hair re newer which in the olden\\ndays when its name was first getting into placard\\ntype saw its virtues modestly hinted at in the\\nsimplest of unrimed and unvarnished advertising\\nefforts:\\nTry Blinker's Hair Renewer for the Hair.\\nIt scarcely seems possible that there was a time,\\nand not long ago, when such a mild, homely group\\nof words was thought to be advertising. Not so\\nto-dav. In these bustling times everything in\\ngeneral and advertising in particular must be spiced\\nand sugar-coated if designed to have the public\\nbite at it. And so the wide-awake framer of up\\nto-date advertising takes that same old theme,\\nonce so mildly treated, and brings it right ho ne\\nto us through the medium of poetry:\\nIf you'd have locks?long, lustrous, rich?\\nUse Blinker's flair Renewer, which\\nWill grow upon the baldest pate\\nHair by the bushel while you wait.\\nOur eyes have become so accustomed to seeing\\na number of lines of reading matter beginning with\\ncapital letters on the one hand and terminating\\nwith words of similar sound on the other that we\\nwould not pause to observe the simple request,\\n\\\"Use Blum's Stove Polish,\\\" which modest com\\nbination of words used to be deemed sufficiently\\nforceful and convincing to attract public notice.\\nTo-day the subject is set forth differently:\\nBlum's Polish makes the stove so bright\\nThe cook declares it blinds her sight\\nAnd so with every package we\\nPresent a pair of goggles free.\\nSo pronounced has become this desire to present\\nwhat were formerly considered purely commercial\\nthemes, in soft, sweet, rhythmic, rattling poetry,\\nthat in some of our more enlightened cities the street\\ncars are now recognized as being the people's true\\nliterary rendezvous. They are the centers?the\\nfive centers, so to speak?of the present day poetic\\nuplift. The whole commercial world, as it is at\\npresent represented in street-car literature, shows\\na growing disposition to lisp in numbers. Where\\nis this movement to stop? Is it ever going to stop?\\nCould we stop it if we would? Would we stop it if\\nwe could?\\nThe mind of man has ever been subservient to the\\npoetic spell. Poetry has always been recognized\\nas the helper and harmonizer of the race. High\\nthinkers of all ages have sought to say compliment\\nary things about it. It is in his poetry rather than\\nin his fine philosophical essays that Emerson is\\nto find his literary immortality. On the other\\nhand, Dickens is doomed to die because his writings\\nlack that poetic quality which, after all is said and\\ndone, is the true breath of literary life. This grave\\ndefect in Dickens is indicated in the words that pass\\nbetween the Wellers, father and son, as the latter\\nreads for the edification of the former the valentine\\nhe has just composed:\\n\\\" 'Tain't in poetry, is it?\\\" interposed the father.\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" replied Sam.\\n\\\" Wery glad to hear it,\\\" said Mr. Weller. \\\"Poetry's\\nunnat'ral. No man ever talked in poetry 'cept a\\nbeadle on boxin' day, or Warren's blackin' or\\nRowland's oil, or some o' them low fellows. Never\\nlot yourself down to talk poetry, my boy.\\\"\\nThen at the conclusion of the effort Sam says:\\n\\\"I could end it with a werse; what do you think?\\\"\\n\\\"I don't like it, Sam,\\\" rejoined Mr. Weller. \\\"I\\nnever know'd a respectable coachman as wrote\\npoetry 'cept one as made an affectin' copy o'\\nwerses the night afore he wos hung for a highway\\nrobbery, and he wos only a Cambervell man, so\\neven that's no rule.\\\"\\nBut the average man, no matter what his station\\nin life, has a touch of sentiment in him and more\\nor less of a fondness for poetry. He remembers\\nthat years ago it was his pleasure to read a poem\\nthat has lingered in his memory ever since. It\\ndescribed the flight of angels from Heaven to earth\\nand how they descended to this planet on a golden\\nladder. While they were viewing the beauty\\nof our earthly Paradise there suddenly appeared a\\nshadow across the land which caused a shudder to\\nsteal through their breasts. They hastened back\\nto the golden ladder to ascend once more to their\\nethereal realms. All were successful in reaching\\nthe ladder before it was withdrawn?all but two.\\nThose two have since been called the belated\\nangels, and the half-forgotten poem closes:\\nAnd those belated angels be\\nSweet Music and sweet Poetry.\\nIt is this hidden sentiment in the hearts of men\\nthat explains why they love poetry. They may\\ndeclare they do not like poetry, but they will read\\nstreet-car poetry. They've simply got to do so\\nunless they own a private carriage or automobile.\\nOne of the world's wise men has wisely told us:\\n\\\"Words are the only things that live forever.\\\"\\nA little couplet or quatrain is easily carried about\\nin the corner of one's mind to be breathed forth\\non any and every occasion. Not until some one\\nof a jingle-making turn of mind remarked that\\nEvening red and morning gray\\nAre sure to fetch a very fine day\\ndid a careless, unobserving world know that these\\ntwo meteorological conditions are the forerunners\\nof fine weather. As a matter of fact, it is probable\\nthat they were not so until this couplet was evolved,\\nsince when the weathi r has been made to conform\\nto the state of things as set forth in the lilting lines.\\nOne of our best-known college professors has\\nsaid: \\\"Whatever your occupation may be, and\\nhowever crowded your hours with affairs, do not\\nfail to secure at least a few minutes every day for\\nthe refreshment of your inner life with a bit of\\npoetry.\\\" As things used to be it was rather difficult\\nfor many of us to come into daily contact with\\npoetry. There were so many prosy duties keeping\\nus on the jump from the time the alarm clock awoke\\nus in the morning till late bedtime at night that\\npoetry was likely to be side-tracked for something\\nthat seemed to l>e of more immediate importance.\\nNow all is charmingly different. For five cents\\nof ttlhe Road\\nBy Morris J. W Kite\\n(In 1895)\\nA narrow rural road,\\nA wheelman a la mode,\\nA farmer who insists on driving straight;\\nAdjoining, banks of sand,\\nNo chance to pass him, and\\nThe cyclist bites the dust in humble state.\\n(In 1905)\\nSame highway once again,\\nSame farmer holds the rein.\\nSame wheelman speeds along*on air-shod steed:\\nFour wheels instead of two,\\nHis automobile new ?\\nThe tables turn?the rural czar is treed.\\nthere will come the moment when,\\ntired and indifferent as to what happens, we\\npermit the eye to find recreation wherever it\\nwill, and from that time forward the poet re\\nreading habit is fixed upon us. As Tennyson\\ntruly says:\\nNo rock so hard but that a little wave\\nMay beat admission in a thousand years.\\nFinally with everybody in the street-car reading\\npoetry, the next step is for them to reflect and\\nrepeat it in their daily walks or rides. Naturally\\nwe may expect the conductors who are about the\\ncars all the time to be the first to show in their\\nmode of speaking the effect of ;uch intimate asso\\nciation with so much poesy. Hence a student of\\nconditions as they exist to-day must not be sur\\nprised to he:ir a conductor say, in addressing a\\nwoman who by burying her face in a book is seeking\\nto convey the impression that she has been on the\\ncar ever since it started from away out in the open\\nlotted suburb:\\nPlease pardon me, but may I dare\\nTo ask you, lady, for your fare?\\nSome may think that this manner of speech is\\ntoo polite for a street-car conductor to employ,\\nbut let it be borne in mind that one of the chief\\nmissions of poetry is to promulgate politeness. A\\nmore general use of the former will insure a more\\nwidespread employment of the latter.\\nIn the winter time when the occupants of the\\nair-tight, non-ventilated, overcrowded car are\\nbreathing the so-called atmosphere it had in it\\nwhen it first left the barn at four-thirty that morn\\ning, some woman with weak lungs will summon up\\njust enough strength and courage to venture to\\nsay to the conductor:\\nDo you presume that it would rob\\nYou of your public-serving job\\nIf, just to save a life, you'd dare\\nAdmit a thimbleful of air?\\nAnd then that wise conductor, a man of years\\nand long suffering, will bend down close to the weak\\nwoman's ear and whisper:\\nI'd like to, lady, but you see\\nThat red-haired man there said to me\\nThat if I dared let in one jot\\nOf frosty air he'd have me shot.\\nIt isn't what we do that counts for so much in\\nthis world as it is the way in which we do it. Man\\nners are everything. The general employment of\\npoetry ought to work a great change for the better\\nin the street-car deportment of the public. It will\\ncertainly be lots nicer for all concerned when the\\nblunt remark; and the sarcastic retorts are re\\nplaced by s noothlv flowing, softly modulated\\ncouplets and quatrains. It is possible, even,\\nthat in the days to come when a conductor attempts\\nto collect a fare for carrying a youth nearly as large\\nas his mother the latter will be content to express\\nherself less crudely than she is likely to do at the\\npresent time:\\nHe's ridden nine years on this route,\\nAnd you're the first to say that he\\nIs more than five years old, you brute.\\nAnd I'll report you, sir! You'll see!\\nAnd then too there is a chance for a big reform\\nto be brought about in the manner in which the\\naverage man gets out of a seat and a woman gets\\ninto it. It is usually done in a bungling, unintelli\\ngent and unintelligible sort of way. But once the\\nstreet-car public becomes fully imbued with the\\nspirit of poesy which the present display of versified\\n\\\"ads\\\" seems certain to bring upon it we shall then\\nexpect a young man to know what to say and how\\nto say it:\\nPray. lady, have my seat, but not\\nBecause you look worn out or hot\\nOr ancient, for it is not so,\\nBut?here's where 1 get out. you know.\\nAnd the young woman?well, as a matter of\\ncourse, she will be thoroughly up with the advanced\\npoetic spirit of the times, as the women always are?\\nshe will say to the young man:\\nYou're very kind, I'm sure, and now\\nI'll show all true-born ladies how\\nTo act when \\\"He\\\" does aught for \\\"Her,\\\"\\nAnd so I shriek it Thank you, sir!\\nEven the cynic must admit that life will be\\nsweeter when the present little poetic street-car\\nadvertising leaven has finally made its influence\\nfelt throughout the whok lump.\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\n",

What is more,\\nthe most of us are so occupied and\\nconditioned that we are compelled to\\ntake a daily ride on a car and like\\nwise to read the aforesaid poetry\\nwhether we like it or not. We may\\nrefuse for a time to glance at it, but\\na chcerless, stupid cage in which an\\nunwilling, ill-natured public was carted from place\\nto place. Now it is fast becoming a veritable cir\\nculating library of poetry and art on wheels. The\\npopulace enters then in with the happy assurance\\nthat while there is small likelihood of its finding an\\nunoccupied seat, it is sure of meeting with many a\\nquaint and curious quatrain of poetic lore calculated\\nto make those who must cling to straps forget all\\ntheir woes and worries in contemplating the plea\\nsant food for thought so temptingly displayed on\\neverv hand.\\nWe've heard about those signs so plain that \\\"he who runs\\nmay read'':\\nBut when it comes to street-ear ads , why, there we do not\\nneed\\nTo run a bit, but idlv sit, al! active movements shunning,\\nAs by the mile we ride the while the car does all the\\nrunning.\\nWith what curious interest the street-car patron\\nhas watched the subtle but all-conquering advance\\nof poetry into the cold commercial world that\\nwas once deemed to be the undisputed realm of\\nplain prose.\\nTime was when poetry was est' erned to be too\\nfragile, too timid, too polite, to appear in mixed\\nassemblages. In those dear old delicate days it\\nwas honestly supposed that a full breath of real\\nbusiness atmosphere would prove almost fatal\\nto a tender triolet or a retiring rondo. But the\\ntimes change, and we are changed with them.\\nNowadays it is no unusual sight to see a sweet,\\nsentinental sonnet and a brisk, business-like sand\\nwich going hand in hand, as it were, about the busy\\nthoroughfares of our bustling cities.\\nTo illustrate the manner in which poetry is over\\ncoming prose, let us take, for example, a certain\\nwell-known brand of hair re newer which in the olden\\ndays when its name was first getting into placard\\ntype saw its virtues modestly hinted at in the\\nsimplest of unrimed and unvarnished advertising\\nefforts:\\nTry Blinker's Hair Renewer for the Hair.\\nIt scarcely seems possible that there was a time,\\nand not long ago, when such a mild, homely group\\nof words was thought to be advertising. Not so\\nto-dav. In these bustling times everything in\\ngeneral and advertising in particular must be spiced\\nand sugar-coated if designed to have the public\\nbite at it. And so the wide-awake framer of up\\nto-date advertising takes that same old theme,\\nonce so mildly treated, and brings it right ho ne\\nto us through the medium of poetry:\\nIf you'd have locks?long, lustrous, rich?\\nUse Blinker's flair Renewer, which\\nWill grow upon the baldest pate\\nHair by the bushel while you wait.\\nOur eyes have become so accustomed to seeing\\na number of lines of reading matter beginning with\\ncapital letters on the one hand and terminating\\nwith words of similar sound on the other that we\\nwould not pause to observe the simple request,\\n\\\"Use Blum's Stove Polish,\\\" which modest com\\nbination of words used to be deemed sufficiently\\nforceful and convincing to attract public notice.\\nTo-day the subject is set forth differently:\\nBlum's Polish makes the stove so bright\\nThe cook declares it blinds her sight\\nAnd so with every package we\\nPresent a pair of goggles free.\\nSo pronounced has become this desire to present\\nwhat were formerly considered purely commercial\\nthemes, in soft, sweet, rhythmic, rattling poetry,\\nthat in some of our more enlightened cities the street\\ncars are now recognized as being the people's true\\nliterary rendezvous. They are the centers?the\\nfive centers, so to speak?of the present day poetic\\nuplift. The whole commercial world, as it is at\\npresent represented in street-car literature, shows\\na growing disposition to lisp in numbers. Where\\nis this movement to stop? Is it ever going to stop?\\nCould we stop it if we would? Would we stop it if\\nwe could?\\nThe mind of man has ever been subservient to the\\npoetic spell. Poetry has always been recognized\\nas the helper and harmonizer of the race. High\\nthinkers of all ages have sought to say compliment\\nary things about it. It is in his poetry rather than\\nin his fine philosophical essays that Emerson is\\nto find his literary immortality. On the other\\nhand, Dickens is doomed to die because his writings\\nlack that poetic quality which, after all is said and\\ndone, is the true breath of literary life. This grave\\ndefect in Dickens is indicated in the words that pass\\nbetween the Wellers, father and son, as the latter\\nreads for the edification of the former the valentine\\nhe has just composed:\\n\\\" 'Tain't in poetry, is it?\\\" interposed the father.\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" replied Sam.\\n\\\" Wery glad to hear it,\\\" said Mr. Weller. \\\"Poetry's\\nunnat'ral. No man ever talked in poetry 'cept a\\nbeadle on boxin' day, or Warren's blackin' or\\nRowland's oil, or some o' them low fellows. Never\\nlot yourself down to talk poetry, my boy.\\\"\\nThen at the conclusion of the effort Sam says:\\n\\\"I could end it with a werse; what do you think?\\\"\\n\\\"I don't like it, Sam,\\\" rejoined Mr. Weller. \\\"I\\nnever know'd a respectable coachman as wrote\\npoetry 'cept one as made an affectin' copy o'\\nwerses the night afore he wos hung for a highway\\nrobbery, and he wos only a Cambervell man, so\\neven that's no rule.\\\"\\nBut the average man, no matter what his station\\nin life, has a touch of sentiment in him and more\\nor less of a fondness for poetry. He remembers\\nthat years ago it was his pleasure to read a poem\\nthat has lingered in his memory ever since. It\\ndescribed the flight of angels from Heaven to earth\\nand how they descended to this planet on a golden\\nladder. While they were viewing the beauty\\nof our earthly Paradise there suddenly appeared a\\nshadow across the land which caused a shudder to\\nsteal through their breasts. They hastened back\\nto the golden ladder to ascend once more to their\\nethereal realms. All were successful in reaching\\nthe ladder before it was withdrawn?all but two.\\nThose two have since been called the belated\\nangels, and the half-forgotten poem closes:\\nAnd those belated angels be\\nSweet Music and sweet Poetry.\\nIt is this hidden sentiment in the hearts of men\\nthat explains why they love poetry. They may\\ndeclare they do not like poetry, but they will read\\nstreet-car poetry. They've simply got to do so\\nunless they own a private carriage or automobile.\\nOne of the world's wise men has wisely told us:\\n\\\"Words are the only things that live forever.\\\"\\nA little couplet or quatrain is easily carried about\\nin the corner of one's mind to be breathed forth\\non any and every occasion. Not until some one\\nof a jingle-making turn of mind remarked that\\nEvening red and morning gray\\nAre sure to fetch a very fine day\\ndid a careless, unobserving world know that these\\ntwo meteorological conditions are the forerunners\\nof fine weather. As a matter of fact, it is probable\\nthat they were not so until this couplet was evolved,\\nsince when the weathi r has been made to conform\\nto the state of things as set forth in the lilting lines.\\nOne of our best-known college professors has\\nsaid: \\\"Whatever your occupation may be, and\\nhowever crowded your hours with affairs, do not\\nfail to secure at least a few minutes every day for\\nthe refreshment of your inner life with a bit of\\npoetry.\\\" As things used to be it was rather difficult\\nfor many of us to come into daily contact with\\npoetry. There were so many prosy duties keeping\\nus on the jump from the time the alarm clock awoke\\nus in the morning till late bedtime at night that\\npoetry was likely to be side-tracked for something\\nthat seemed to l>e of more immediate importance.\\nNow all is charmingly different. For five cents\\nof ttlhe Road\\nBy Morris J. W Kite\\n(In 1895)\\nA narrow rural road,\\nA wheelman a la mode,\\nA farmer who insists on driving straight;\\nAdjoining, banks of sand,\\nNo chance to pass him, and\\nThe cyclist bites the dust in humble state.\\n(In 1905)\\nSame highway once again,\\nSame farmer holds the rein.\\nSame wheelman speeds along*on air-shod steed:\\nFour wheels instead of two,\\nHis automobile new ?\\nThe tables turn?the rural czar is treed.\\nthere will come the moment when,\\ntired and indifferent as to what happens, we\\npermit the eye to find recreation wherever it\\nwill, and from that time forward the poet re\\nreading habit is fixed upon us. As Tennyson\\ntruly says:\\nNo rock so hard but that a little wave\\nMay beat admission in a thousand years.\\nFinally with everybody in the street-car reading\\npoetry, the next step is for them to reflect and\\nrepeat it in their daily walks or rides. Naturally\\nwe may expect the conductors who are about the\\ncars all the time to be the first to show in their\\nmode of speaking the effect of ;uch intimate asso\\nciation with so much poesy. Hence a student of\\nconditions as they exist to-day must not be sur\\nprised to he:ir a conductor say, in addressing a\\nwoman who by burying her face in a book is seeking\\nto convey the impression that she has been on the\\ncar ever since it started from away out in the open\\nlotted suburb:\\nPlease pardon me, but may I dare\\nTo ask you, lady, for your fare?\\nSome may think that this manner of speech is\\ntoo polite for a street-car conductor to employ,\\nbut let it be borne in mind that one of the chief\\nmissions of poetry is to promulgate politeness. A\\nmore general use of the former will insure a more\\nwidespread employment of the latter.\\nIn the winter time when the occupants of the\\nair-tight, non-ventilated, overcrowded car are\\nbreathing the so-called atmosphere it had in it\\nwhen it first left the barn at four-thirty that morn\\ning, some woman with weak lungs will summon up\\njust enough strength and courage to venture to\\nsay to the conductor:\\nDo you presume that it would rob\\nYou of your public-serving job\\nIf, just to save a life, you'd dare\\nAdmit a thimbleful of air?\\nAnd then that wise conductor, a man of years\\nand long suffering, will bend down close to the weak\\nwoman's ear and whisper:\\nI'd like to, lady, but you see\\nThat red-haired man there said to me\\nThat if I dared let in one jot\\nOf frosty air he'd have me shot.\\nIt isn't what we do that counts for so much in\\nthis world as it is the way in which we do it. Man\\nners are everything. The general employment of\\npoetry ought to work a great change for the better\\nin the street-car deportment of the public. It will\\ncertainly be lots nicer for all concerned when the\\nblunt remark; and the sarcastic retorts are re\\nplaced by s noothlv flowing, softly modulated\\ncouplets and quatrains. It is possible, even,\\nthat in the days to come when a conductor attempts\\nto collect a fare for carrying a youth nearly as large\\nas his mother the latter will be content to express\\nherself less crudely than she is likely to do at the\\npresent time:\\nHe's ridden nine years on this route,\\nAnd you're the first to say that he\\nIs more than five years old, you brute.\\nAnd I'll report you, sir! You'll see!\\nAnd then too there is a chance for a big reform\\nto be brought about in the manner in which the\\naverage man gets out of a seat and a woman gets\\ninto it. It is usually done in a bungling, unintelli\\ngent and unintelligible sort of way. But once the\\nstreet-car public becomes fully imbued with the\\nspirit of poesy which the present display of versified\\n\\\"ads\\\" seems certain to bring upon it we shall then\\nexpect a young man to know what to say and how\\nto say it:\\nPray. lady, have my seat, but not\\nBecause you look worn out or hot\\nOr ancient, for it is not so,\\nBut?here's where 1 get out. you know.\\nAnd the young woman?well, as a matter of\\ncourse, she will be thoroughly up with the advanced\\npoetic spirit of the times, as the women always are?\\nshe will say to the young man:\\nYou're very kind, I'm sure, and now\\nI'll show all true-born ladies how\\nTo act when \\\"He\\\" does aught for \\\"Her,\\\"\\nAnd so I shriek it Thank you, sir!\\nEven the cynic must admit that life will be\\nsweeter when the present little poetic street-car\\nadvertising leaven has finally made its influence\\nfelt throughout the whok lump.\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\n",

What is more,\\nthe most of us are so occupied and\\nconditioned that we are compelled to\\ntake a daily ride on a car and like\\nwise to read the aforesaid poetry\\nwhether we like it or not. We may\\nrefuse for a time to glance at it, but\\na chcerless, stupid cage in which an\\nunwilling, ill-natured public was carted from place\\nto place. Now it is fast becoming a veritable cir\\nculating library of poetry and art on wheels. The\\npopulace enters then in with the happy assurance\\nthat while there is small likelihood of its finding an\\nunoccupied seat, it is sure of meeting with many a\\nquaint and curious quatrain of poetic lore calculated\\nto make those who must cling to straps forget all\\ntheir woes and worries in contemplating the plea\\nsant food for thought so temptingly displayed on\\neverv hand.\\nWe've heard about those signs so plain that \\\"he who runs\\nmay read'':\\nBut when it comes to street-ear ads , why, there we do not\\nneed\\nTo run a bit, but idlv sit, al! active movements shunning,\\nAs by the mile we ride the while the car does all the\\nrunning.\\nWith what curious interest the street-car patron\\nhas watched the subtle but all-conquering advance\\nof poetry into the cold commercial world that\\nwas once deemed to be the undisputed realm of\\nplain prose.\\nTime was when poetry was est' erned to be too\\nfragile, too timid, too polite, to appear in mixed\\nassemblages. In those dear old delicate days it\\nwas honestly supposed that a full breath of real\\nbusiness atmosphere would prove almost fatal\\nto a tender triolet or a retiring rondo. But the\\ntimes change, and we are changed with them.\\nNowadays it is no unusual sight to see a sweet,\\nsentinental sonnet and a brisk, business-like sand\\nwich going hand in hand, as it were, about the busy\\nthoroughfares of our bustling cities.\\nTo illustrate the manner in which poetry is over\\ncoming prose, let us take, for example, a certain\\nwell-known brand of hair re newer which in the olden\\ndays when its name was first getting into placard\\ntype saw its virtues modestly hinted at in the\\nsimplest of unrimed and unvarnished advertising\\nefforts:\\nTry Blinker's Hair Renewer for the Hair.\\nIt scarcely seems possible that there was a time,\\nand not long ago, when such a mild, homely group\\nof words was thought to be advertising. Not so\\nto-dav. In these bustling times everything in\\ngeneral and advertising in particular must be spiced\\nand sugar-coated if designed to have the public\\nbite at it. And so the wide-awake framer of up\\nto-date advertising takes that same old theme,\\nonce so mildly treated, and brings it right ho ne\\nto us through the medium of poetry:\\nIf you'd have locks?long, lustrous, rich?\\nUse Blinker's flair Renewer, which\\nWill grow upon the baldest pate\\nHair by the bushel while you wait.\\nOur eyes have become so accustomed to seeing\\na number of lines of reading matter beginning with\\ncapital letters on the one hand and terminating\\nwith words of similar sound on the other that we\\nwould not pause to observe the simple request,\\n\\\"Use Blum's Stove Polish,\\\" which modest com\\nbination of words used to be deemed sufficiently\\nforceful and convincing to attract public notice.\\nTo-day the subject is set forth differently:\\nBlum's Polish makes the stove so bright\\nThe cook declares it blinds her sight\\nAnd so with every package we\\nPresent a pair of goggles free.\\nSo pronounced has become this desire to present\\nwhat were formerly considered purely commercial\\nthemes, in soft, sweet, rhythmic, rattling poetry,\\nthat in some of our more enlightened cities the street\\ncars are now recognized as being the people's true\\nliterary rendezvous. They are the centers?the\\nfive centers, so to speak?of the present day poetic\\nuplift. The whole commercial world, as it is at\\npresent represented in street-car literature, shows\\na growing disposition to lisp in numbers. Where\\nis this movement to stop? Is it ever going to stop?\\nCould we stop it if we would? Would we stop it if\\nwe could?\\nThe mind of man has ever been subservient to the\\npoetic spell. Poetry has always been recognized\\nas the helper and harmonizer of the race. High\\nthinkers of all ages have sought to say compliment\\nary things about it. It is in his poetry rather than\\nin his fine philosophical essays that Emerson is\\nto find his literary immortality. On the other\\nhand, Dickens is doomed to die because his writings\\nlack that poetic quality which, after all is said and\\ndone, is the true breath of literary life. This grave\\ndefect in Dickens is indicated in the words that pass\\nbetween the Wellers, father and son, as the latter\\nreads for the edification of the former the valentine\\nhe has just composed:\\n\\\" 'Tain't in poetry, is it?\\\" interposed the father.\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" replied Sam.\\n\\\" Wery glad to hear it,\\\" said Mr. Weller. \\\"Poetry's\\nunnat'ral. No man ever talked in poetry 'cept a\\nbeadle on boxin' day, or Warren's blackin' or\\nRowland's oil, or some o' them low fellows. Never\\nlot yourself down to talk poetry, my boy.\\\"\\nThen at the conclusion of the effort Sam says:\\n\\\"I could end it with a werse; what do you think?\\\"\\n\\\"I don't like it, Sam,\\\" rejoined Mr. Weller. \\\"I\\nnever know'd a respectable coachman as wrote\\npoetry 'cept one as made an affectin' copy o'\\nwerses the night afore he wos hung for a highway\\nrobbery, and he wos only a Cambervell man, so\\neven that's no rule.\\\"\\nBut the average man, no matter what his station\\nin life, has a touch of sentiment in him and more\\nor less of a fondness for poetry. He remembers\\nthat years ago it was his pleasure to read a poem\\nthat has lingered in his memory ever since. It\\ndescribed the flight of angels from Heaven to earth\\nand how they descended to this planet on a golden\\nladder. While they were viewing the beauty\\nof our earthly Paradise there suddenly appeared a\\nshadow across the land which caused a shudder to\\nsteal through their breasts. They hastened back\\nto the golden ladder to ascend once more to their\\nethereal realms. All were successful in reaching\\nthe ladder before it was withdrawn?all but two.\\nThose two have since been called the belated\\nangels, and the half-forgotten poem closes:\\nAnd those belated angels be\\nSweet Music and sweet Poetry.\\nIt is this hidden sentiment in the hearts of men\\nthat explains why they love poetry. They may\\ndeclare they do not like poetry, but they will read\\nstreet-car poetry. They've simply got to do so\\nunless they own a private carriage or automobile.\\nOne of the world's wise men has wisely told us:\\n\\\"Words are the only things that live forever.\\\"\\nA little couplet or quatrain is easily carried about\\nin the corner of one's mind to be breathed forth\\non any and every occasion. Not until some one\\nof a jingle-making turn of mind remarked that\\nEvening red and morning gray\\nAre sure to fetch a very fine day\\ndid a careless, unobserving world know that these\\ntwo meteorological conditions are the forerunners\\nof fine weather. As a matter of fact, it is probable\\nthat they were not so until this couplet was evolved,\\nsince when the weathi r has been made to conform\\nto the state of things as set forth in the lilting lines.\\nOne of our best-known college professors has\\nsaid: \\\"Whatever your occupation may be, and\\nhowever crowded your hours with affairs, do not\\nfail to secure at least a few minutes every day for\\nthe refreshment of your inner life with a bit of\\npoetry.\\\" As things used to be it was rather difficult\\nfor many of us to come into daily contact with\\npoetry. There were so many prosy duties keeping\\nus on the jump from the time the alarm clock awoke\\nus in the morning till late bedtime at night that\\npoetry was likely to be side-tracked for something\\nthat seemed to l>e of more immediate importance.\\nNow all is charmingly different. For five cents\\nof ttlhe Road\\nBy Morris J. W Kite\\n(In 1895)\\nA narrow rural road,\\nA wheelman a la mode,\\nA farmer who insists on driving straight;\\nAdjoining, banks of sand,\\nNo chance to pass him, and\\nThe cyclist bites the dust in humble state.\\n(In 1905)\\nSame highway once again,\\nSame farmer holds the rein.\\nSame wheelman speeds along*on air-shod steed:\\nFour wheels instead of two,\\nHis automobile new ?\\nThe tables turn?the rural czar is treed.\\nthere will come the moment when,\\ntired and indifferent as to what happens, we\\npermit the eye to find recreation wherever it\\nwill, and from that time forward the poet re\\nreading habit is fixed upon us. As Tennyson\\ntruly says:\\nNo rock so hard but that a little wave\\nMay beat admission in a thousand years.\\nFinally with everybody in the street-car reading\\npoetry, the next step is for them to reflect and\\nrepeat it in their daily walks or rides. Naturally\\nwe may expect the conductors who are about the\\ncars all the time to be the first to show in their\\nmode of speaking the effect of ;uch intimate asso\\nciation with so much poesy. Hence a student of\\nconditions as they exist to-day must not be sur\\nprised to he:ir a conductor say, in addressing a\\nwoman who by burying her face in a book is seeking\\nto convey the impression that she has been on the\\ncar ever since it started from away out in the open\\nlotted suburb:\\nPlease pardon me, but may I dare\\nTo ask you, lady, for your fare?\\nSome may think that this manner of speech is\\ntoo polite for a street-car conductor to employ,\\nbut let it be borne in mind that one of the chief\\nmissions of poetry is to promulgate politeness. A\\nmore general use of the former will insure a more\\nwidespread employment of the latter.\\nIn the winter time when the occupants of the\\nair-tight, non-ventilated, overcrowded car are\\nbreathing the so-called atmosphere it had in it\\nwhen it first left the barn at four-thirty that morn\\ning, some woman with weak lungs will summon up\\njust enough strength and courage to venture to\\nsay to the conductor:\\nDo you presume that it would rob\\nYou of your public-serving job\\nIf, just to save a life, you'd dare\\nAdmit a thimbleful of air?\\nAnd then that wise conductor, a man of years\\nand long suffering, will bend down close to the weak\\nwoman's ear and whisper:\\nI'd like to, lady, but you see\\nThat red-haired man there said to me\\nThat if I dared let in one jot\\nOf frosty air he'd have me shot.\\nIt isn't what we do that counts for so much in\\nthis world as it is the way in which we do it. Man\\nners are everything. The general employment of\\npoetry ought to work a great change for the better\\nin the street-car deportment of the public. It will\\ncertainly be lots nicer for all concerned when the\\nblunt remark; and the sarcastic retorts are re\\nplaced by s noothlv flowing, softly modulated\\ncouplets and quatrains. It is possible, even,\\nthat in the days to come when a conductor attempts\\nto collect a fare for carrying a youth nearly as large\\nas his mother the latter will be content to express\\nherself less crudely than she is likely to do at the\\npresent time:\\nHe's ridden nine years on this route,\\nAnd you're the first to say that he\\nIs more than five years old, you brute.\\nAnd I'll report you, sir! You'll see!\\nAnd then too there is a chance for a big reform\\nto be brought about in the manner in which the\\naverage man gets out of a seat and a woman gets\\ninto it. It is usually done in a bungling, unintelli\\ngent and unintelligible sort of way. But once the\\nstreet-car public becomes fully imbued with the\\nspirit of poesy which the present display of versified\\n\\\"ads\\\" seems certain to bring upon it we shall then\\nexpect a young man to know what to say and how\\nto say it:\\nPray. lady, have my seat, but not\\nBecause you look worn out or hot\\nOr ancient, for it is not so,\\nBut?here's where 1 get out. you know.\\nAnd the young woman?well, as a matter of\\ncourse, she will be thoroughly up with the advanced\\npoetic spirit of the times, as the women always are?\\nshe will say to the young man:\\nYou're very kind, I'm sure, and now\\nI'll show all true-born ladies how\\nTo act when \\\"He\\\" does aught for \\\"Her,\\\"\\nAnd so I shriek it Thank you, sir!\\nEven the cynic must admit that life will be\\nsweeter when the present little poetic street-car\\nadvertising leaven has finally made its influence\\nfelt throughout the whok lump.\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\n",

Poems are more easy to re\\nmember than prose because of their\\nrhyme. In prose we have things told\\njust as though we were talking to each\\nother. Prose is used to tell almost any\\nkind of a story or to describe anything.\\nThere are beautiful scenes in the world,\\ngrand things in history and noble\\nthoughts that can be much better de\\nscribed in poetry.\\nWhen our far-off forefathers could\\nrot even read or write they had poets\\n\\u2022who went with them into battle and\\nafter the victory these poets or 'bards'\\nas they were called would compose\\nverses of fine-sounding words to cele\\nbrate the victory. These verses were\\nsung while they played the harp. Per\\nhaps in this way poetry began and\\nmen found they could best utter their\\nhappiness by choosing words of a\\nmusical sound.\\nThere are three kinds of poetry.\\n\\u2022Dramatic poetry is written in the form\\nof people speaking to each other as in\\nthe plays of Shakespeare. Then we\\nhave epic poetry which is usually a\\ndescription of some great event, or\\n.hero, or the history of a nation. The\\nthird is called lyric poetry because it\\n\\u2022was originally intended to be sung to\\nthe playing of the lyre. All beautiful\\nsongs fall in the lyric class of poetry.\\nWe know poems sometimes rhyme\\nand sometimes they do not. The num-\\\"\\nber of syllables in a line of poetry de\\npends on the plan of the poet. We-can\\ntrain ourselves to^know when there\\nare too many or too few for the plan.\\nThis also helps in the rhythm of music.\\nMuch of our finest poetry has no\\nrhyme in it. A poem with no rhyme\\nIs called \\\"blank verse.'\\nWe can understand great poems\\n\\u2022without knowing all about the differ*\\nent styles of poetry. Strictly speaking\\na single line of poetry is a verse, but\\nusually any number of lines over two\\nIs called a verse.. Another name for\\na verse is stanza. Short verses of only\\ntwo lines or any pair of lines ending\\n\\u2022with the same rhyme are called coutf\\nlets.\\nThere are many divisions of lyric\\n^poetry. A very popular form is the'\\nsennet which is the most beautiful\\nstyle of all the shorter poems. A son\\n-net is composed of fourteen lines\\u2014no\\n'more or less. Some of our finest\\npoetry is in the form of these little\\nfourteen-line\\n~mr\\npoems.

Few . poets know anything\\nabout life.\\nIt is horrible to think of a person who\\ncan only write; does nothing but write;\\nwho simply draws from his brain \\\"color-'\\nless images that do not exist; who feeds\\nupon himself, exaggerates his own Im\\nportance and ,' sees the world only, and\\nfalsely . within himself.

I have seen the brains of poets\\nactually die.\\nThe writing of poetry unquestionably\\ndrives many poets to drlrk. It drives\\nmany to the gutter. I hava no doubt the\\nvery obsession of poetry drove Poe to\\ntake relief in wine, that it drove him to\\nwander about, often half mad, and caused\\nhim to suffer incredibly. It might have\\nbeen a wonderful thing for Poe had he,\\nlike Le Oalllenne, taken to farming or like\\nElla Wheeler Wilcox, interested himself\\nin ethics and sane newspaper editorials,\\nsuch work would have com\\npelled him to view sane,\\nhealthy life; to realize the re\\nsponsibilities of life first of\\nall to himself. Many people\\ntell anecdotes of his borrow\\ning money and failing\\nto return it. That Is very\\npitiful, and seems in bad\\ntaste. Poe's worst injus\\ntices were to himself; he\\nsuffered poverty conse\\nquently.\\nVerlaine was an ex\\nample of a man whom\\npoetry drove to the gut\\nter. He was so obsessed\\nwith poetry that he be\\ncame a tramp; he- lost\\nall Interest In his person\\nal appearance; his poems'\\nare wonderful, but peo\\nple who met him said\\nthat at times it was\\npainful to look at him.\\nCertainly he was not\\nsane it might have been\\nwell had he given up\\npoetry for awhile.\\nDe Maupassant who\\nwrote fiction besides\\npoetry, . became Insane.\\nHe thought so Intensely\\nof the terrible in\\nvisible horror in his \\\"Horla\\\"\\nthat he began to imagine the\\nthing existed and actually pur\\nsued him.

If I wrote\\nlong enough about the Sphinx, and\\nbrooded on the subject with the morbid\\nintentness that some poets give to their\\nsubjects, I have no doubt that it would\\nbecome an obsession. I might develop\\nthe hallucination that the Sphinx con\\nfided her secret to me.\\nDe Maupassant told Paul Bourget that\\nhe often saw his double. Were I to go\\nso far and Imagine I saw my double I\\n. fear I might then really go mad from\\njealousy! ,\\nI could name many poets : who took\\nto drink or went insane. There was Ger\\nard de Nerval, who was first obsessed\\nwith mysticism. He drank horribly and\\nwhen he went to the gardens of the\\nTuilerles imagined he saw the gold fish\\nlifting their heads from the water and\\ninviting him to follow them into the\\nfountains.\\nGerard de Nerval became haunted - by\\nthe imaginary beings he created. He\\nalways said the Queen of Sheba was wait\\ning Just around the corner for him. Imag\\nine my condition were I to go so far as\\nto become convinced that the \\\"beast of\\nthe Apocalypse,\\\" of which I've written,\\nwas waiting about every corner for me!\\nAs it is, I used to be afraid of the dark;\\nsince I decided to give up poetry the\\ndark no longer holds terrors for me,\\nMyt fear was unquestionably due to an\\nover-excited imagination. '\\nNerval also developed a curious mania.\\nHe dragged a lobster about the streets\\nof Paris with him, and when his physi\\ncian, a solicitous soul, objected. Nerval\\nnaively expressed his astonishment He\\nsaw no reason why any one should object\\nto his airing his pet why, he said inno\\ncently, lobsters were more ' inoffensive\\nthan dogs; they never even barked. Re\\ncently a young man appeared in the Wal\\ndorf dining room with a cat on the head\\nof which was a crown of brilliants. I\\nam sure he was a poet no one but a poet\\nwould do anything so extraordinary as\\ntake an angora to the Waldorf for lunch.\\nRecently Richard Le Galllenne wrote\\nme a letter telling me of a wonderful\\nwater bug he had caught and of which\\nhe made a pet His enthusiasm over\\nthe water bug amazed me I thought he\\nwas joking. Other letters followed. He\\nwrote me about his daily observations\\nof the bug',\\\"how he kept it In a'glass\\nand gave it fresh water daily. He was\\nbecoming very fond of it he said. Then\\nI learned that during this episode he was\\ndeeply Immersed in writing a poem\\nfortunately the water bug died; other\\nwise he might have developed a fasci\\nnation for the beetle. He expressed heart\\nbroken grief when it died.\\nPoetry has driven many men poets to\\nsuicide. Nerval hanged himself. I have\\nno intention of bringing on such a fate\\nmyself, although I have no doubts many\\nof our younger poets would rejoice at\\nsuch an act\\nChatterton killed himself. Klelst, a\\nwidely known German poet did also.\\nMany thought of it, even if they didn't\\ncarry out their intention among them\\nthe poet Cooper. Perhaps it might have\\nbeen well if he had done so; It would\\nhave saved the writing of much Inferior\\ndrivel. , .\\nBaudelaire might 'as well . have killed\\nhimself he died from general paresis.\\nHe wrote wonderful poetry, but became\\nso mentally unbalanced that he took to\\nopium. He dyed his hair green. I know\\nof a few poets to-day who dye their hair\\nbut not green. - One\\nday Baudelaire tried to\\nstrangle his father-in-law\\nthis fact, despite\\nthe statement that he\\ndied of softening of\\nthe brain, leads me to\\n-uBpeci mat ne may\\nhave had lucid moments.\\nPoetry drives many\\npoets to drugs. There\\nwas de Musset, who\\ndrugged himself with a\\nfrightful mixture of beer\\nand absinthe; he then\\nimagined he saw his\\ndouble and that sounds\\nhad colors. He often\\nhypnotized himself with\\na gilt frame most of\\nthe poets I know do it\\nsimply with a mirror.\\nPoets often develop\\nthe mania of persecution.\\nThey imagine that the\\ncritics are always un\\nfairly treating them. Ber\\nnardin de St. Pierre de\\nveloped this idea so\\nstrongly that .he im\\nagined the people in\\nthe street paused to\\ncriticise him.\\nOther poets have had\\ncurious aberrations.\\nSchiller, the German\\npoet, used to com\\npose with his feet on\\nice. The odor of fer\\nmenting apples delighted\\nhim.\\nByron,, it Is said,\\nhad convulsions when\\nhe heard Kern re\\ncite. He sometimes\\nimagined he was visited by a ghost\\nPoets develop all sorts of habits they\\ncannot control. I know a poetess who\\nworked vherself into the habit of writing\\nsonnets.

Another poet insists always\\nin sitting with his back to the wall and\\nwalking close to buildings in the streets.\\nOnce I asked him why. \\\"I am afraid, of\\nopen spaces,\\\" he replied.\\nThere Is a young poet In New York '\\nwho writes beautiful poems about mad\\nness. He declares It the most wonderful\\nthing in the world. That rather indicates,\\nhowever, that he is perfectly sane.\\nConsidering the dangers of writing\\npoetry, I think it would be safer for a .\\nperson to go through typhoid than to suc\\ncumb to the poetic afflatus. Few poets\\nsurvive it. So, for the time being. at .\\nleast, I shall write no more.\\nWith even the greatest of writers,\\nthe longer they write the more incompre-\\nsensible they become. There is Thomas\\nHardy, one of the biggest men in modern\\nliterature. No one can understand his\\nlast work, \\\"The Dynasts.\\\" It is a literary\\nmystery. With poets, however, in the\\ncourse of years they become so mysteri\\nous, so complex, that no one can under\\nstand their work. Why, I found it actu\\nally necessary to write a commentary\\nin my last book explaining my. poems.\\nAfter I write verses I often forget what\\ntney mean. I must keep copious notes.\\nWhy, if I kept on writing poetry until I\\nwas thirty a boo of mine would simply\\nconsist of one sonnet the rest would be\\na commentary explaining it.\\nRecently I wrote a poem, \\\"Pierrot Cru\\ncified.\\\" I forgot to make a note explaining\\nits meaning.

I heard a very instruc\\ntive and interesting.talk by Prof. Mc\\nClintock at the Lawndaje Civic Cen\\nter on \"The Value of Popular\\nPoetry.\" \"The greatest art of the\\npoet,\" said the learned professor, \"is\\nto study popular taste and give them\\nwhat they want\"\\nIt is unfortunate that the classes\\nunderstand so well the psychology of\\nthe masses and are therefore able to\\nplay upon their emotion as a musi\\ncian plays upon a harp. They feed\\nthem with poetry which appeals to\\nthe most ingrained prejudices of\\nman.\\nPoetry is not creative at best That\\nis, it does not .teach nor discover\\noriginal ideas; it either tends to ap\\npeal to the emotions and prejudices\\nof the race, or it revolves round some\\nprogressive idea as a sattelite and\\nhelps to inspire humanitarians to\\nfight until they have reached their\\ngoal.\\nPopular poetry is not poetry which\\nappeals wholly to the primitive feel\\nings of man, as that appeals to all\\nsections of mankind. The poetry the\\npeople are fed with is such as tend\\nto aid to perpetuate existing institu\\ntions.. The prpfessor said that the people\\nwere not intellectual but they are es\\nsentially sentimental. They like grue\\nsome and realistic tales. True, but\\nthe profesor failed to give the rea\\nsons for such popular taste.\\nTo the classes such taste appeals\\nto be low, popular and vulgar. For\\nit is easy for men who do not know\\nthe turmoils and strifes of life to\\nutter opinions on the low tastes and\\nsentimentality of the people. The\\nmasses find woe and sorrow at every\\nangle they turn. That is the reason\\nwhy woeful stories touch them. The\\nwealthy classes know of no other\\nwoes but that which nature imposes\\nupon them. The people suffer untold\\nmiseries which man imposes upon\\nman, hence their extreme sentimen\\ntality. The mental energies of the work\\ners exhausts itself in their daily\\ndrudgery and toil, therefore they do\\nnot think clearly upon their own in\\nterests. But a new and happier day\\nis dawning on the human horizon.\\nThe workers are demanding better\\nopportunities of self development and\\nfor self-expression. The spirit of as\\npiration animates them with the\\nsame zeal as it animated aristocratic\\nFaust, but the spirit of negation is\\nkeener in their case.\\nThe day will eventually dawn when,\\nthe titan of capitalism and oppres\\nsion will be conquered. Then \"The\\nAbysm will vomit forth the secrets\\nof nature\" even to the disinherited\\nmultitude. Sam Druck.\\nTEACHERS\\' HOURS. I have\\nheard so many confused statements\\nmade regarding the working hours of\\nteachers and their \"easy\" work that\\nI am constrained to give to those\\nwho \"desire truth and justice above\\nall things\" a real knowledge of the\\nactual facts.\\nAll teachers must be in their rooms\\nat 8:45 a. m. and 1 p. m. or be marked\\ntardy. This makes five and one-half\\nhours of compulsory work to begin\\nwith. The bookkeeping necessary\\nto -keeping records of attendance,\\npunctuality, grading and marking\\nexamination papers must be done out\\nof school hours.\\nIn every grade there is preparatory\\nwork to be done, so that every teach\\ner necessarily works from one to\\nthree hours more than the five and\\na half we started with. High school\\nteachers go on duty at least 15 min\\nutes before 9 a. m., have 30 minutes\\nfor lunch (and perhaps have to eat\\nthat in a study room in charge of\\nstudents.)

He remembers\\nthat years ago it was his pleasure to read a poem\\nthat has lingered in his memory ever since. It\\ndescribed the flight of angels from Heaven to earth\\nand how they descended to this planet on a golden\\nladder. While they were viewing the beauty\\nof our earthly Paradise there suddenly appeared a\\nshadow across the land which caused a shudder to\\nsteal through their breasts. They hastened back\\nto the golden ladder to ascend once more to their\\nethereal realms. All were successful in reaching\\nthe ladder before it was withdrawn?all but two.\\nThose two have since been called the belated\\nangels, and the half-forgotten poem closes:\\nAnd those belated angels be\\nSweet Music and sweet Poetry.\\nIt is this hidden sentiment in the hearts of men\\nthat explains why they love poetry. They may\\ndeclare they do not like poetry, but they will read\\nstreet-car poetry. They\\'ve simply got to do so\\nunless they own a private carriage or automobile.\\nOne of the world\\'s wise men has wisely told us:\\n\"Words are the only things that live forever.\"\\nA little couplet or quatrain is easily carried about\\nin the corner of one\\'s mind to be breathed forth\\non any and every occasion. Not until some one\\nof a jingle-making turn of mind remarked that\\nEvening red and morning gray\\nAre sure to fetch a very fine day\\ndid a careless, unobserving world know that these\\ntwo meteorological conditions are the forerunners\\nof fine weather. As a matter of fact, it is probable\\nthat they were not so until this couplet was evolved,\\nsince when the weathi r has been made to conform\\nto the state of things as set forth in the lilting lines.\\nOne of our best-known college professors has\\nsaid: \"Whatever your occupation may be, and\\nhowever crowded your hours with affairs, do not\\nfail to secure at least a few minutes every day for\\nthe refreshment of your inner life with a bit of\\npoetry.\" As things used to be it was rather difficult\\nfor many of us to come into daily contact with\\npoetry. There were so many prosy duties keeping\\nus on the jump from the time the alarm clock awoke\\nus in the morning till late bedtime at night that\\npoetry was likely to be side-tracked for something\\nthat seemed to l>e of more immediate importance.\\nNow all is charmingly different. For five cents\\nof ttlhe Road\\nBy Morris J. W Kite\\n(In 1895)\\nA narrow rural road,\\nA wheelman a la mode,\\nA farmer who insists on driving straight;\\nAdjoining, banks of sand,\\nNo chance to pass him, and\\nThe cyclist bites the dust in humble state.\\n(In 1905)\\nSame highway once again,\\nSame farmer holds the rein.\\nSame wheelman speeds along*on air-shod steed:\\nFour wheels instead of two,\\nHis automobile new ?\\nThe tables turn?the rural czar is treed.\\nthere will come the moment when,\\ntired and indifferent as to what happens, we\\npermit the eye to find recreation wherever it\\nwill, and from that time forward the poet re\\nreading habit is fixed upon us. As Tennyson\\ntruly says:\\nNo rock so hard but that a little wave\\nMay beat admission in a thousand years.\\nFinally with everybody in the street-car reading\\npoetry, the next step is for them to reflect and\\nrepeat it in their daily walks or rides. Naturally\\nwe may expect the conductors who are about the\\ncars all the time to be the first to show in their\\nmode of speaking the effect of ;uch intimate asso\\nciation with so much poesy. Hence a student of\\nconditions as they exist to-day must not be sur\\nprised to he:ir a conductor say, in addressing a\\nwoman who by burying her face in a book is seeking\\nto convey the impression that she has been on the\\ncar ever since it started from away out in the open\\nlotted suburb:\\nPlease pardon me, but may I dare\\nTo ask you, lady, for your fare?\\nSome may think that this manner of speech is\\ntoo polite for a street-car conductor to employ,\\nbut let it be borne in mind that one of the chief\\nmissions of poetry is to promulgate politeness. A\\nmore general use of the former will insure a more\\nwidespread employment of the latter.\\nIn the winter time when the occupants of the\\nair-tight, non-ventilated, overcrowded car are\\nbreathing the so-called atmosphere it had in it\\nwhen it first left the barn at four-thirty that morn\\ning, some woman with weak lungs will summon up\\njust enough strength and courage to venture to\\nsay to the conductor:\\nDo you presume that it would rob\\nYou of your public-serving job\\nIf, just to save a life, you\\'d dare\\nAdmit a thimbleful of air?\\nAnd then that wise conductor, a man of years\\nand long suffering, will bend down close to the weak\\nwoman\\'s ear and whisper:\\nI\\'d like to, lady, but you see\\nThat red-haired man there said to me\\nThat if I dared let in one jot\\nOf frosty air he\\'d have me shot.\\nIt isn\\'t what we do that counts for so much in\\nthis world as it is the way in which we do it. Man\\nners are everything. The general employment of\\npoetry ought to work a great change for the better\\nin the street-car deportment of the public. It will\\ncertainly be lots nicer for all concerned when the\\nblunt remark; and the sarcastic retorts are re\\nplaced by s noothlv flowing, softly modulated\\ncouplets and quatrains. It is possible, even,\\nthat in the days to come when a conductor attempts\\nto collect a fare for carrying a youth nearly as large\\nas his mother the latter will be content to express\\nherself less crudely than she is likely to do at the\\npresent time:\\nHe\\'s ridden nine years on this route,\\nAnd you\\'re the first to say that he\\nIs more than five years old, you brute.\\nAnd I\\'ll report you, sir! You\\'ll see!\\nAnd then too there is a chance for a big reform\\nto be brought about in the manner in which the\\naverage man gets out of a seat and a woman gets\\ninto it. It is usually done in a bungling, unintelli\\ngent and unintelligible sort of way. But once the\\nstreet-car public becomes fully imbued with the\\nspirit of poesy which the present display of versified\\n\"ads\" seems certain to bring upon it we shall then\\nexpect a young man to know what to say and how\\nto say it:\\nPray. lady, have my seat, but not\\nBecause you look worn out or hot\\nOr ancient, for it is not so,\\nBut?here\\'s where 1 get out. you know.\\nAnd the young woman?well, as a matter of\\ncourse, she will be thoroughly up with the advanced\\npoetic spirit of the times, as the women always are?\\nshe will say to the young man:\\nYou\\'re very kind, I\\'m sure, and now\\nI\\'ll show all true-born ladies how\\nTo act when \"He\" does aught for \"Her,\"\\nAnd so I shriek it Thank you, sir!\\nEven the cynic must admit that life will be\\nsweeter when the present little poetic street-car\\nadvertising leaven has finally made its influence\\nfelt throughout the whok lump.', 'batch': 'dlc_weimaraner_ver02', 'title_normal': 'evening star.', 'url': 'https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1905-11-19/ed-1/seq-41.json', 'place': ['District of Columbia--Washington'], 'page': '13'}, {'sequence': 42, 'county': [None], 'edition': None, 'frequency': 'Daily', 'id': '/lccn/sn83045462/1905-11-19/ed-1/seq-42/', 'subject': ['Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505', 'Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers.'], 'city': ['Washington'], 'date': '19051119', 'title': 'Evening star.

Not so\\nto-dav. In these bustling times everything in\\ngeneral and advertising in particular must be spiced\\nand sugar-coated if designed to have the public\\nbite at it. And so the wide-awake framer of up\\nto-date advertising takes that same old theme,\\nonce so mildly treated, and brings it right ho ne\\nto us through the medium of poetry:\\nIf you\\'d have locks?long, lustrous, rich?\\nUse Blinker\\'s flair Renewer, which\\nWill grow upon the baldest pate\\nHair by the bushel while you wait.\\nOur eyes have become so accustomed to seeing\\na number of lines of reading matter beginning with\\ncapital letters on the one hand and terminating\\nwith words of similar sound on the other that we\\nwould not pause to observe the simple request,\\n\"Use Blum\\'s Stove Polish,\" which modest com\\nbination of words used to be deemed sufficiently\\nforceful and convincing to attract public notice.\\nTo-day the subject is set forth differently:\\nBlum\\'s Polish makes the stove so bright\\nThe cook declares it blinds her sight\\nAnd so with every package we\\nPresent a pair of goggles free.\\nSo pronounced has become this desire to present\\nwhat were formerly considered purely commercial\\nthemes, in soft, sweet, rhythmic, rattling poetry,\\nthat in some of our more enlightened cities the street\\ncars are now recognized as being the people\\'s true\\nliterary rendezvous. They are the centers?the\\nfive centers, so to speak?of the present day poetic\\nuplift. The whole commercial world, as it is at\\npresent represented in street-car literature, shows\\na growing disposition to lisp in numbers. Where\\nis this movement to stop? Is it ever going to stop?\\nCould we stop it if we would? Would we stop it if\\nwe could?\\nThe mind of man has ever been subservient to the\\npoetic spell. Poetry has always been recognized\\nas the helper and harmonizer of the race. High\\nthinkers of all ages have sought to say compliment\\nary things about it. It is in his poetry rather than\\nin his fine philosophical essays that Emerson is\\nto find his literary immortality. On the other\\nhand, Dickens is doomed to die because his writings\\nlack that poetic quality which, after all is said and\\ndone, is the true breath of literary life.

Poems are more easy to re\\nmember than prose because of their\\nrhyme. In prose we have things told\\njust as though we were talking to each\\nother. Prose is used to tell almost any\\nkind of a story or to describe anything.\\nThere are beautiful scenes in the world,\\ngrand things in history and noble\\nthoughts that can be much better de\\nscribed in poetry.\\nWhen our far-off forefathers could\\nrot even read or write they had poets\\n•who went with them into battle and\\nafter the victory these poets or \\'bards\\'\\nas they were called would compose\\nverses of fine-sounding words to cele\\nbrate the victory. These verses were\\nsung while they played the harp. Per\\nhaps in this way poetry began and\\nmen found they could best utter their\\nhappiness by choosing words of a\\nmusical sound.\\nThere are three kinds of poetry.\\n•Dramatic poetry is written in the form\\nof people speaking to each other as in\\nthe plays of Shakespeare. Then we\\nhave epic poetry which is usually a\\ndescription of some great event, or\\n.hero, or the history of a nation. The\\nthird is called lyric poetry because it\\n•was originally intended to be sung to\\nthe playing of the lyre. All beautiful\\nsongs fall in the lyric class of poetry.\\nWe know poems sometimes rhyme\\nand sometimes they do not. The num-\"\\nber of syllables in a line of poetry de\\npends on the plan of the poet. We-can\\ntrain ourselves to^know when there\\nare too many or too few for the plan.\\nThis also helps in the rhythm of music.\\nMuch of our finest poetry has no\\nrhyme in it. A poem with no rhyme\\nIs called \"blank verse.\\'\\nWe can understand great poems\\n•without knowing all about the differ*\\nent styles of poetry. Strictly speaking\\na single line of poetry is a verse, but\\nusually any number of lines over two\\nIs called a verse.. Another name for\\na verse is stanza. Short verses of only\\ntwo lines or any pair of lines ending\\n•with the same rhyme are called coutf\\nlets.\\nThere are many divisions of lyric\\n^poetry. A very popular form is the\\'\\nsennet which is the most beautiful\\nstyle of all the shorter poems. A son\\n-net is composed of fourteen lines—no\\n\\'more or less. Some of our finest\\npoetry is in the form of these little\\nfourteen-line\\n~mr\\npoems.

In a markdown section, look over what you have done, and try changing the search *parameter* at the top of the exercise. What changes when you re run the activity?
